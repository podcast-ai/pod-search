THE FOLLOWING is a CONVERSATION WITH DEMIS ASABIS C O AND COFFANDER OF DEEP MIND. DAMIS IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT AND IMPACTFUL HUMANS IN THE HISTORY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING E GENERAL. HIS SHOW is BROUGHT TO BY MAIL GON BY SENCH AN EMAL DELIVERY SERVICE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO PROGRAMMATICALLY SEND E MILLS.ASSEMBLER AND ANDA ALSO AMOS BASIC THIS O THIS THIS PACIFIC FORMER BASIC NWAS CONCREDIBLE ACTUALLY SWELL ON ALL MY CODING SKILLS AND WHEN DID YOU FOND LOVE WITH A A SO When DID YOU FIRST START TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU CAN NOT JUST WRITE PROGRAMMES THAT DO SOME MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS FOR YOU WHILE YOU SLEEP.IT WOULD BE NICE TO DO ALMOST LIKE ALPHAC LS O PROGRAMMING YOWLES SOGENERATING RULES THAT KIND OF O THAT THAT THAT AUTOMATE EVEN THAT PART OF THE GENERATION OF RULes. I THINK THA WILD BE SUPSUPER A A POWERFUL TOOL THAT SH LEAVE FOR FOR BALANCING AUTO BALANCing AGAIN WHICH USUALLY TAKES THOUSANDS OF HOURS FROM HUNDREDS of GAMES HUMAN GAMES TESTERS NORMALLY TO TO BALIEW ABOUT THESE EARLY DAYS OF ALPHOFOLD OF OF SOLVING THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE ON LIKE GAMES THIS IS REAL PHYSICAL SYSTEM S That are LESS AMENTABLE TO SELF PLAYTAPAMECHANISMS. YAH ISIGHT MY IND WIT E AFFERFOLD IS THE MOST COMPLEX AND ALSO PROBABLY MOST MEANINGFUL SYSTEM WE'VE BUILT SO far.ERING KINGS CROSS WITH THE CRUICK IN STATUE CROSS THE ROAD AND DUM AND I THINK THE NEXT STEPS YOU KNOW THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME AMAZING ADVANCES IN BALOGY BUILT ON TOP OF THINGS LIKE ALFERFOL D A WE AL READY SEEING THAT WITH THE COMMUNITY DOING THAT AFTER WE'VE OPEN SAUC AND RELEASED IT AM AND DA YOU KNOW I OUGHT I OFTEN SAY THAT I TH think A F YOU THINK OF A MATHEMATICS IS THE PERPOR MOLECULES WE WOULD LIKE TO SIMILATE LARGE MATERIALS AM AND SO A TO DAY THERE'S NO WAY OF DOING THAT AND WE're BUILDing UP TOWARDS OR BUILDING FUNCTIONALS THE APPRO OXIMATE SHROWNING IS EQUATION AND THEN ALLOW YOU TO DESCRIBE AA WHAT THE ELECTRONES ARE DOING.TICLLULO I WOULDN'T BE THAT SURPRISED IF WE SAW SINGle LELSE SUCH A SINGLE CELL SORT of LIFE FORMS ELSEWHERE A BACTERIO TYPE THINGS. MALTICELLIA LIFE SEEMS INCREDIBLY HARD THAT STEP OF YOU KNOW CAPTURING MITER CONJREOR AND THEN ITS SORT OF USING THAT AS PART OF YOURSELF.AND THAT'S WHY I SAY I THINK AS A FIRST STEP IT WOULD BE BETTER IF WE HAVE THE CHOICE TO BUILD THESE SYSTEMS OF TOOLS TO GIVE AN END I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT SHOULD NEVER THEY SHOULD NEVER GO BEYOND TAULL ECAUSE OF COURSE THE POTENTIAL IS THERE AM FOR IT TO GO AWAY BEYond JUST TOOLs AH BUT AM I TH think THAT WOULD be A GOOD FUR STEP IN ORDER FOR US TO YOU KNOW LLOW US TO CAREFULLY EXPERIMENT UNDERSTAND WHAT
