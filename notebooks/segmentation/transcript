0,48,416.24,430.32,Music.,,16
0,49,432.301,444.718,Let's start with the basic question but maybe not so basic after all what is Marxism what are the defining characteristics of Marxism as an economic and political Theory and ideology.,0.85,17
0,50,444.958,451.938,Well the simplest way to begin a definition would be to say it's the tradition that takes its,0.9,17
0,51,451.863,460.022,founding inspiration from The Works of Karl Marx but because,0.91,17
0,52,459.956,469.339,"these ideas that he put forward spread as fast as they did and as globally as they did,",0.91,17
0,53,469.408,474.362,literally it's 140 years since Marks died.,0.85,17
0,54,474.756,483.104,And in that time his ideas have become major types of thinking in every country on the,0.87,18
0,55,483.02,497.219,Earth if you know much about the great ideas of human history that's an extraordinary spread in an extraordinarily short period of historical time,0.91,18
0,56,497.117,503.557,and what that has meant that speed of spread and that Geographic diversity,0.91,18
0,57,503.428,512.352,is that the marxian ideas interacted with very different cultural histories religious histories,0.86,18
0,58,512.241,514.107,and economic conditions.,0.91,18
0,59,514.447,528.448,So the end result was that the ideas were interpreted differently in different places at different times and therefore Marxism as a kind of first flush definition is the,0.89,18
0,60,528.409,537.414,"totality of all of these very different ways of coming to terms with it for the,",0.91,18
0,61,537.429,547.092,roughly 40 50 years Marxism was a tradition of thinking critically about capitalism,0.81,18
0,62,546.972,559.641,Marx himself that's all he really did he never wrote a book about communism in ever wrote a book really about socialism either his comments were occasional fragmentary dispersed,0.91,18
0,63,559.521,564.169,what he was really interested in was a critical analysis of capitalism.,0.85,18
0,64,564.661,573.972,And that's what Marxism was more or less in its first 40 or 50 years the only.,0.78,19
0,65,574.474,585.414,Qualification of what I just said was something that happened in Paris for a few weeks in 1871 there was a collapse of the French.,0.91,20
0,66,585.709,596.514,Consequent upon losing a war to bismarck's Germany and in the result was something called the Paris commune the working class of Paris rose up,0.88,20
0,67,596.493,600.7,basically took over the function of running,0.91,20
0,68,600.679,615.536,the Parisian economy and the Parisian society and Marxist people people influenced by marks were very active in that Community the leadership of the Communist and Marx wasn't that far away he was in London.,0.78,20
0,69,615.785,623.242,These things were happening in Paris you know that's an easy transport even then and for a short time.,0.79,20
0,70,623.689,627.446,"Very short
Marxism had a different.",0.88,20
0,71,628.01,638.465,Quality in addition to being a critique of capitalism it became a theory of how to organize Society differently.,0.91,21
0,72,638.561,647.413,Before that had only been implicit now it became explicit what is the leadership of the Paris commune going to do,0.9,21
0,73,647.338,654.381,and why and in what order in other words governing organizing a society.,0.87,21
0,74,654.576,669.505,But since it only lasted a few weeks the French army regrouped and under the leadership of people were very opposed to Mark's they March back in the Paris took over killed a large number of the.,0.85,21
0,75,669.664,679.254,Of the communards as they were called and deported them to islands in the Pacific that the were part of the French Empire at the time.,0.85,21
0,76,679.521,684.43,The really big change happens in Russia in 1917 that now you have.,0.91,21
0,77,684.634,689.679,A group of marxist sledding Trotsky all the rest who.,0.78,21
0,78,690.009,695.224,Or in this bizarre position to seize a.,0.88,21
0,79,695.437,701.724,Once again a warlike in France this organizes the.,0.8300000000000001,21
0,80,701.946,709.421,Throws the government into a very bad reputation because it is the government that losers World War One,0.85,21
0,81,709.418,717.487,has to withdraw as you know brest-litovsk in all of that and the government collapses and the army revolts.,0.87,21
0,82,717.853,722.861,And in that situation a very small political party.,0.91,22
0,83,723.2,731.368,Russian Social Democratic Workers Party splits under the pressures of all of this.,0.8200000000000001,22
0,84,731.968,734.645,Into the Bolshevik and menshevik.,0.79,23
0,85,734.939,745.232,Divisions Lenin Trotsky and the others are in the Bolshevik Division and to make a long story short he's in Exile his position Lenin's position,0.89,23
0,86,745.229,750.219,makes him gets him deported because he says Russian workers should not be.,0.88,23
0,87,750.729,759.779,Killing German Workers are be this is a war of capitalist who are dividing the world up into colonies and Russian working people have no.,0.8200000000000001,23
0,88,760.226,765.109,Should not kill and should not die for such a thing as you can expect.,0.8300000000000001,23
0,89,765.223,774.822,They arrest him and they throw him out interestingly in the United States the the comparable leader at that time of the Socialist Party here.,0.88,23
0,90,774.981,785.697,As you know there was no Communist party at this point that comes later the head of the Socialist Party is very important American figure named Eugene Victor Debs,0.76,24
0,91,785.604,794.798,"makes exactly the same argument to the Americans should not fight in the war he's in the past has nothing to do with Lana I don't even know if they,",0.86,24
0,92,794.858,801.631,"no of each other but he does it on his own he gets arrested and put in jail here in the United States,",0.86,24
0,93,801.691,805.565,by the way runs for president from jail and does very well.,0.91,24
0,94,805.688,815.53,"Really very well remarkable and he's the inspiration for Bernie Sanders if you you see the link although he had much more,",0.84,24
0,95,815.554,829.556,courage politically than Bernie has that's the internet I'd love to return to that link maybe later yes history Rhymes yes the complicated story anyway with the importance in terms of Marxism is that now,0.91,24
0,96,829.49,832.752,this seizure of power.,0.91,24
0,97,832.884,844.851,By a group of marxists that is a group of people inspired by marks developing what you might call a Russian even though they were differences among the Russians too but,0.86,25
0,98,844.704,853.241,a Russian interpretation this now has to be transformed from a critique of capitalism,0.85,25
0,99,853.166,861.1,into a plan at least what are you going to do in the Soviet Union and a lot of this was then trial,0.88,25
0,100,860.989,865.07,never marks never laid any of this out,0.67,25
0,101,864.968,873.001,probably wouldn't have been all that relevant if he had because it was 50 years earlier in another country Etc so what,0.86,25
0,102,872.872,884.38,begins to happen and you can see how this happens and more later in China and Cuba and Vietnam and Korea and so on is that you have kind of a bifurcation.,0.86,25
0,103,884.638,893.805,Much of Marxism remains chiefly the critique of capitalism but another part of it becomes.,0.8300000000000001,26
0,104,893.946,898.531,A set and they differ from one to the other a set of Notions.,0.7000000000000001,26
0,105,898.645,912.134,"Of what an alternative post-capitalist Society or to look like how it ought to work and there's lots of disagreement about it lots of confusion and I would say that,",0.84,26
0,106,912.158,919.966,"that's still where it is that you have a tradition now that has these two major Wings critique of capitalism,",0.8200000000000001,26
0,107,919.972,930.156,notion of the alternative and then a variety of each of those and that would be the framework in which I would answer that's what Marxism is about,0.91,26
0,108,930.144,935.26,it's basic idea if you had to have one is that Human Society.,0.91,26
0,109,935.726,941.607,I can do better than capitalism and it ought to try and then we can start to talk about.,0.72,26
0,110,942.018,954.633,What we mean by capitalism fine so we'll look at the critique of capitalism on one side but maybe stepping back what do you think marks would say if you just looked at the,0.91,26
0,111,954.432,964.275,different implementations of the ideas of Marxism throughout the 20th century were his ideas that were implicit were made explicit.,0.8300000000000001,26
0,112,965.244,974.15,Would would he shake his head would he enjoy some of the parts of the implementations like what how do you think he would analyze it,0.91,27
0,113,974.12,979.102,well he had a great sense of humor I don't know if you had a chance to take a look at his writing but,0.84,27
0,114,979.009,991.993,he had an extraordinary sense of humors are my guess is he would deploy his humor and answering this question too he would say some of them are inspiring some of his interpretations of his work and he's very pleased with those.,0.87,27
0,115,992.161,1003.363,Others are horrifying and he wishes somehow he could erase the connection between those things and the lineage they claim from him which he would.,0.9,27
0,116,1004.242,1012.176,There's a German word I don't know if he's lying if you speak the other languages know there's a wonderful German word called Fete Sita,0.88,28
0,117,1012.038,1025.859,and it's stronger than the word refuse it's if if you want to refuse something but with real strong emphasis has shifted the how is a German way of saying I know whatever you to do that.,0.84,28
0,118,1026.235,1036.689,And he would talk and you know in philosophical terms because remember he was a student of philosophy he wrote his doctoral thesis on Ancient Greek philosophy and all the rest.,0.91,28
0,119,1036.92,1044.449,He would wax philosophical and say you know that the idea is you put out or a little bit like having a child.,0.8,28
0,120,1044.77,1054.496,You have a lot of influence but the child is his own or her own person and will find his or her own way and these ideas once they're out there.,0.87,28
0,121,1055.204,1066.604,Go their own way and as you said there's a particular way that this idea spread the speed at which it spread throughout the world made it even less able to be sort of stabilized right,0.8300000000000001,29
0,122,1066.466,1072.752,and connected back to the origins of where the idea came from the only people who ever really tried that.,0.84,29
0,123,1073.163,1079.504,With the Russians After the Revolution because they occupy the position for a while not very long,0.81,29
0,124,1079.456,1083.258,but they occupy the position for a while in which,0.79,29
0,125,1083.138,1093.88,"he was exalted right there have been all these people criticizing capitalism for a long time even the Marxist ever since mid century and these were the first guys,",0.84,29
0,126,1093.932,1095.393,who pulled it off.,0.91,29
0,127,1095.561,1110.409,They made it and so that there was a kind of presumption around the world their interpretation must be kind of the right one because look they did it and so for a while they could,0.91,29
0,128,1110.289,1121.004,enunciate their interpretation and it came to be widely grasped as something which by the way gets called in the literature,0.91,29
0,129,1120.956,1135.084,official Marxism the very idea that you would put that adjectives in front of Marxism or Soviet Marxism or Russian my there were these words that were the adjective was meant to somehow say,0.9,29
0,130,1135.0,1143.753,kind of this is the Canon we've been depart from it but this is the cannon before the Russian Revolution there was no such thing and.,0.76,29
0,131,1144.245,1152.602,By the 1960s it was already displayed it was gone but for a short time 30 40 years.,0.8300000000000001,30
0,132,1153.238,1159.219,It was a kind of and the irony is particularly here in the United States.,0.91,31
0,133,1159.558,1167.807,Where the taboo against Marxism kicks in right after World War 2 is so total in this country that.,0.74,31
0,134,1168.137,1175.585,I for example through most of my adult life have had to spend a ridiculous amount of my time,0.79,31
0,135,1175.51,1183.939,simply explaining to American audiences that the Marxism they take as canonical,0.87,31
0,136,1183.837,1194.58,is that old Soviet Marxism which wasn't the cannon before 1917 and hasn't been since at least the 1960s,0.8,31
0,137,1194.424,1200.044,"but they don't know it's not that they're stupid and it's not that they're ignorant it's that,",0.91,31
0,138,1200.077,1208.74,will need Millions maybe about any it's not a mental problem it's the taboo shut it down and so all of the reopening,0.78,31
0,139,1208.719,1215.807,that in a way re captures what went before and develops it in New Direction they just don't know,0.91,31
0,140,1215.768,1227.339,but nevertheless it's a serious attempt at making the implicit ideas explicit the the Russians the Soviets at the beginning of the 20th century,0.85,31
0,141,1227.273,1235.522,made a serious attempt at saying okay beyond the critique of capitalism how do we actually build a system like this and so in that sense.,0.79,31
0,142,1236.707,1242.31,Not at a high level but at a detailed level it's interesting to look at those particular,0.88,32
0,143,1242.118,1256.821,schools may be right because for example let me just take your point one step further you really cannot understand the Cuban Revolution the Chinese Revolution Vietnamese and the others because each of them,0.91,32
0,144,1256.729,1261.17,is a kind of response let's call it.,0.8200000000000001,32
0,145,1261.293,1274.916,To the way the Soviets did it are you going to do it that way well yes and no is the answer this we will do that way but that were not going to do and the differences are huge,0.87,32
0,146,1274.913,1282.235,but you could find a thread I can do that for you if you want in which all of them are in a way reacting.,0.9,32

0,148,1284.87,1299.735,"very much so like maybe most of rock music is reacting to The Beatles and the stones there's something like that oh can you speak to the unique elements of the various schools of that Soviet Marxism so we got leninism,",0.89,33
0,149,1299.804,1309.35,trotskyism stalinism maybe even let's expand out to maoism so maybe I could speak to sort of leninism.,0.86,33

0,152,1331.258,1340.867,Stalinism when interesting so Stalin's implementation of all of this one interesting characteristic is to move away from the international aspect.,0.78,34

0,154,1343.61,1351.921,Make it all about Nation nationalism the strength of nation and then Somalia ism is.,0.87,34
0,155,1352.333,1360.537,It's different in that it's focused on agriculture and Rural and then trotskyism I don't know.,0.88,34
0,156,1360.66,1374.454,"Except that it's anti Stalin I mean I don't even know if there's unique sort of philosophical almost there anyway can you maybe from those or something else speak to different unique elements that are interesting to think about,",0.88,34
0,157,1374.478,1380.891,about implementation of Marxism in the real world probably the best way to get in the into this.,0.88,34
0,158,1381.329,1389.542,Is to describe something that happened in Marxism that then shapes the answer to your question.,0.9,34

0,165,1437.35,1442.691,And you might say the first half to two-thirds of his life are about.,0.9,36
0,166,1443.228,1448.444,The critique of capitalism and that was what.,0.91,36
0,167,1448.981,1457.005,In a broad sense the audience for his work Western Europe more or less was interested in that's what they wanted.,0.91,36
0,168,1457.56,1467.294,And he gave that to them he wasn't the only one but he was very very effective at it by the last third of his life.,0.91,37

0,175,1518.631,1532.273,"And the question became how do we do this not anymore should we why should we could we maybe fix capital is no they had gotten to the point the system has to be fundamentally changed,",0.9,39

0,177,1533.638,1543.436,they didn't go yet where you might imagine they didn't go insane but what will that new system looks like they didn't go that way what they did was ask the question how.,0.76,39
0,178,1543.766,1555.454,Could we get Beyond capitalism it seems so powerful it seems to have captured people's minds people's daily lives and so on and the.,0.91,39
0,179,1555.55,1570.28,Focus of the conversation became this was already by the last third of the 19th century the question of the agency to mechanism whereby we would get Beyond and again make a long story short.,0.91,39
0,180,1570.377,1576.438,The conversation focused on seizing the government.,0.91,39
0,181,1577.02,1586.8,She before that it wasn't that the government was not a major interest if you read Marx's Capital the great work of his maturity three volumes,0.79,40
0,182,1586.653,1594.407,there's almost nothing in the in the state he mentions it Polly he's interested in the details of how capitalism works,0.8300000000000001,40
0,183,1594.278,1608.486,Factory by factory store by store author what's the structure the government secondary for him but there's also humans within that capitalist system of there's the working class right it's about that's what I did ruggle,0.87,40
0,184,1608.339,1621.701,that's what he's interested in each in the world think of it almost mechanically like the workplace in the workplace there some people who do this and other people who do that and they accept this division of authority and they,0.91,40
0,185,1621.527,1627.886,fish division what's going on here particularly because he believed that the core economic.,0.85,40
0,186,1628.27,1636.33,Objective of capitalism was to maximize something called profit which his analysis located right there in the.,0.86,41
0,187,1636.444,1646.332,Workings of the Enterprise and not in the government was not that the key factor here and he was looking at ideas of value yes how much is the.,0.8,41
0,188,1646.653,1650.176,"How much value does the labor of the individual,",0.89,41
0,189,1650.182,1661.356,workers provide in that means how do we reward the workers in an ethical way so those are the questions of what would we get here okay but the government,0.88,41
0,190,1661.264,1673.149,is real and part of that picture okay so it's very significant that towards the end of the 19th century Marxist still alive on this begins but it's it really gets going after he dies,0.84,41
0,191,1672.993,1679.271,is this debate among marxists about the role of the state.,0.85,41
0,192,1679.403,1691.298,They all agreed nearly all of them agree that you have to get the say the the working class has to get the state because they see the state as the.,0.8,41

0,278,2419.074,2433.652,in Stanford in the one semester I studied with him he gave me plenty to read but nobody else so that's really interesting you've mentioned that in the past and that's very true which makes you a very interesting figure.,0.91,61
0,279,2434.288,2441.403,To hold your ground intellectually through this idea space we're just people.,0.91,62
0,280,2441.598,2449.082,Don't really even talk about it perhaps we can discuss historically why that is but nevertheless that's the case so.,0.81,62
0,281,2449.547,2457.211,"Moxie in economics did Karl Marx come up in conversation as a kind of dismissive,",0.78,62
0,282,2457.244,2472.047,the best example yeah he came up only as an object of dismissal for giving example the major textbook and economics that I was taught with and that pig was for many years the canonical book isn't quite anymore.,0.84,62
0,283,2472.179,2481.292,Was a book authored by a professor of Economics at MIT named Paul Samuelson and people kind of you know a whole generation or two,0.89,62
0,284,2481.19,2487.593,what drained on his textbook if you open the cover of its textbook he has a tree.,0.86,62
0,285,2487.69,2499.189,And you know and the tree is Adam Smith and David Ricardo at the root and then the different branches of he's trying to give you an idea as a student of how the thing.,0.8200000000000001,62
0,286,2499.6,2509.568,And it's a tree and everybody on it is the Bourgeois and then this is one little Branch goes off like this and so starts heading back down,0.79,62
0,287,2509.484,2520.047,that's Karl Marx in other words he had to have it Complete because he's not a complete Faker but beyond that no there was no nothing in the book gives you.,0.87,62
0,288,2520.224,2523.602,Two paragraphs of an approach.,0.91,62
0,289,2524.122,2534.306,But that's Cold War I mean that's really that's really neither here to that that's the craziness yeah that's the Cold War in this country my professors were afraid of anyway let me get to the.,0.81,63
0,290,2534.546,2542.129,To the core of it when I think it will help Marx was interested in the relationship of people,0.78,63
0,291,2542.126,2556.893,in the process of production that he's interested in the factory the officers store what goes on and by that he means what are the relationships among the people that come together in a workplace.,0.88,63
0,292,2557.358,2558.981,And.,0.91,63
0,293,2559.321,2569.1,What he analyzes is that there is something going on there that has not been adequately understood.,0.91,63
0,294,2569.178,2576.5,And that has not been adequately addressed as an object needing transformation,0.91,63
0,295,2576.434,2584.566,what does he mean the answer is exploitation which he defines mathematically in the following way.,0.91,63
0,296,2585.139,2590.4,Whenever in a society any society you organized.,0.86,64
0,297,2590.514,2598.141,"People suck adults not to children not to sicken but you know healthy adults
in the following way.",0.91,64
0,298,2598.733,2601.166,A big block of them a clear majority.,0.91,65
0,299,2601.586,2611.294,Work that is they use their brains and their muscles to transform nature a tree into a chair a sheep into a wool sweater whatever.,0.74,65
0,300,2611.912,2619.486,In every human Community marks argues there are the people who do that work but they always produce.,0.88,66
0,301,2619.879,2625.589,More chairs more sweaters more hamburgers than they themselves consume.,0.89,66
0,302,2625.704,2634.753,Whatever their standard of living doesn't have to be low to be medium can be hard but they always produce more than they themselves.,0.73,66
0,303,2635.345,2650.03,That more by The Wager marks when he writes this uses the German word Mayor mhr which is the English equivalent of more it's the more that more got badly translated into the word,0.87,67
0,304,2649.965,2653.451,"Surplus shouldn't it in,",0.79,67
0,305,2653.503,2661.841,but it was by the way by German and English people doing the translations what's the difference between more and surplus is there a nuanced,0.8300000000000001,67
0,306,2661.785,2675.156,yeah because Surplus has a notion of its discretionary it's sort of extra he's not taking a not making a judgment that it's a simple math equation yes very simple one - together,0.86,67
0,307,2675.054,2675.723,yes,0.91,67
0,308,2675.603,2688.074,x minus X is X is the total output Y is the consumption by the producer therefore x minus y equals s the Surplus exactly.,0.77,67
0,309,2688.188,2690.243,Now Marx argues.,0.59,67
0,310,2691.6,2699.687,The quit the minute you understand this you will ask the following question who gets the Surplus.,0.8,68
0,311,2699.792,2708.239,Who gets this extra stuff that is made but not consumed by those who made it and Marx's answer is.,0.89,68
0,312,2708.434,2716.818,Therein lies one of the great Shapers of any society how is that organized for example who gets it,0.91,68
0,313,2716.725,2730.844,what are they asked if anything to do with it in real exchange forgetting you what's their social role for example here we go now if you get this and you get the core of it anyway,0.8300000000000001,68
0,314,2730.751,2733.86,"and I don't charge much,",0.8300000000000001,68
0,315,2733.866,2745.239,"the workers themselves will get less than lawyers that that's right the workers themselves could get it yes that's the closest marks comes to a definition of communism,",0.85,68
0,316,2745.271,2752.557,communism would would be if the workers who produce the Surplus together,0.91,68
0,317,2752.473,2761.442,decide what to do with it so this has to do not just with who gets it but more importantly who gets to decide who gets it.,0.91,68
0,318,2761.674,2764.971,Who gets it and who gets to decide what to do with it.,0.85,68
0,319,2765.256,2775.171,Because you can't decide it if you don't have disposition over it so the the lot this the logic of the word sequence it's produced.,0.84,69
0,320,2775.312,2783.561,It's box uses the word appropriated in other words whose property who gets to decide if you like what happens,0.9,69
0,321,2783.468,2794.895,all the property ever meant is who gets to desire and whose excluded that's a clean definition of communism for right that's the by the way it's not just clean the only one,0.91,69
0,322,2794.793,2801.017,so what's can we just Linger on the definition of exploitation yes contacts easy,0.86,69
0,323,2800.905,2810.784,becomes very easy to exploitation exists if and when the Surplus that's produced is taken and distributed by people,0.9,69
0,324,2810.673,2816.158,other than those who produced it slaves produces Surplus which the master gets,0.8300000000000001,69
0,325,2816.092,2822.244,surfs producer Surplus which the Lord gets employees produce a surplus,0.76,69
0,326,2822.151,2826.61,"which the employer gets it's very simple,",0.91,69
0,327,2826.679,2836.881,these are exploited t''v class structures because one class produces a surplus appropriated.,0.91,69
0,328,2837.014,2838.511,"Distributed,",0.91,70
0,329,2838.517,2852.528,by another group of people who not the ones who produced it which creates hostility and midi Envy anger resentment and all of the problems you can lump under the heading,0.81,70
0,330,2852.515,2860.422,class struggle I use a metaphor simple metaphorical story you have two children let's assume,0.91,70
0,331,2860.329,2875.204,and you take them to Central Park a few blocks from here it's a nice day and the children are playing and incomes one of those men with a ice cream truck comes by ding a ling a ling a ling your children's either ice cream daddy get me an ice cream,0.91,70
0,332,2875.165,2882.334,so you walk over you take some money and you get two ice cream cones and you give them to one of the children.,0.89,70
0,333,2883.195,2886.25,The other one begins to scream and yell and how.,0.89,71
0,334,2886.58,2893.281,Obviously what's the issue and you realize you've just made a terrible mistake so you order.,0.91,71
0,335,2893.701,2899.852,The one you gave the two ice cream cones to give one of those to your sister or your brother or whatever it is.,0.91,71
0,336,2900.452,2909.854,And that that's how you solve the problem until a psychologist comes along and says you know you didn't fix it by what you just did.,0.91,72
0,337,2910.517,2913.932,You should never have done that in the first place.,0.91,73

0,339,2925.551,2934.493,Giving the ice cream cone back to the kid you should you should never do this in the first place a reallocation of resources creates bitterness and heartless,0.8200000000000001,74
0,340,2934.409,2944.224,look at our weave this country is tearing itself apart now in a way that I had never seen in my life and I've lived here all my life and I've worked here all my life.,0.74,74
0,341,2944.402,2958.43,It's tearing itself apart and it's tearing itself apart basically over the read division the redistribution of wealth having so badly distributed in the fur but that's all in marks.,0.91,74
0,342,2958.58,2966.928,And notice as I explained to you what is going on in this tension-filled production seen in the officer Factory the store.,0.74,74
0,343,2967.195,2977.677,I don't have to say a word about the government not interested in the government the government's really have a very secondary matter to this core question and here comes the big.,0.89,74

0,346,2992.717,3002.559,you can call yourself a Marxist all day long but you're not getting the point of the Marxism the point was not who the exploiter is but the exploitation,0.8200000000000001,75
0,347,3002.52,3017.485,per se you got to change the organization of the workplace so there isn't a group that makes all the decisions and gets the Surplus very visibly another one that produces it if you do that you will destroy,0.91,75
0,348,3017.311,3018.98,the whole project you will,0.91,75

0,421,3643.887,3655.224,Of a factor of production like a worker in the textbook when it's taught I've taught this stuff I hold my nose but I teach it then I explain to students what I just taught you is,0.89,89
0,422,3655.095,3660.688,horse shit but I first I teach it what is the marginal product if I might be useful it's an ocean is.,0.76,89

0,426,3678.843,3697.129,of the product usually in real terms of physical not the value you could do a value but it's really more the physical your if I mean I there is a transformation thing well I'd love to talk to you about about value is so interesting yeah what is value be glad to talk to you about value and price and all of that,0.85,89

0,431,3724.439,3739.341,to do that so the the meaning that you can't just remove a worker and have a clean mathematical calculation of the effect that it has on the outputs one because too many other things are going on too many things are changing and you cannot assume.,0.8,90
0,432,3739.455,3742.501,Much as you want to that the outcome.,0.91,90

0,440,3809.385,3821.109,You know it's really about capitalism economics as a discipline is born with cap and there was no such thing when I teach I teach courses at the University for example call history of economic thought.,0.8,92
0,441,3821.276,3824.808,All right and I begin the students with Aristotle and Plato.,0.76,92

0,443,3839.551,3853.85,economics broadly defy it made no sense that's a creation much much later that's capitalism that did that created the feel of so when I give them Plato and Aristotle I have to give them particular passages.,0.89,92

0,445,3855.674,3868.064,Because your audience will like it Plato and Aristotle talked about markets because they lived at a time in ancient Greece when Market relations were beginning to intrude upon these,0.9,93

0,447,3869.061,3883.71,so they were both interested in this phenomenon that we're not just producing goods and then Distributing among us we're doing it in a quid pro quo you know I'll give you three oranges you give me two shirts a market exchange,0.8,93
0,448,3883.572,3889.805,and both Aristotle and Plato hated markets denounced them and for the same reason.,0.8,93
0,449,3890.027,3905.37,They destroy social cohesion they destroy Community they make some people rich and other people poor and they set us against each other and is terrible and that here's what they agreed on that here's what they disagreed on one of them,0.87,94

0,454,3939.602,3954.387,so the the fundamentally the destructive thing of a market is that the engine of capitalism and so it creates exploitation of the worker it facility I wouldn't concede that's to facilitate facilitates it and it is an institution,0.8200000000000001,94
0,455,3954.213,3956.52,that Plato and Aristotle feel,0.79,94

0,466,4036.818,4042.843,Suppose you took us your problem we have a set of funds that can be loaned out.,0.9,97
0,467,4043.597,4048.479,People don't want to consume it they ready to lend it okay.,0.85,98
0,468,4049.412,4056.977,To whom should they lend it what we could say in our society we're going to run this the way professors,0.78,99

0,471,4075.663,4082.876,and that one because they're more not needed in our society we are in Greater need of solving this problem,0.91,99
0,472,4082.684,4092.086,then that problem and so we're going to lend money to people working on this problem more readily or more money than we lend over here because we're going to.,0.91,99
0,473,4092.38,4095.731,But instead what we do is who can pay the highest interest rate.,0.91,99
0,474,4096.017,4110.774,Whoa what what what do you do it why what ethics would justify you do it it's like a market in general something is in shortage or markets are about how to handle shortage that's one basic way to understand it.,0.86,99
0,475,4111.402,4116.437,And so if the demand is greater than the supply which is all the word shortage.,0.9,100
0,476,4116.596,4126.258,Means has no other meaning if the demand is greater than the supply okay now you got a problem you can't satisfy all the demand errs.,0.91,100
0,477,4126.48,4138.501,Because you don't have enough Supply you have a shortage okay now how are you going to do it in a market you will allow people who have a lot of money to bid up the price of whatever is short.,0.9,100
0,478,4138.615,4142.03,That solves your problem because as the price goes up.,0.91,100
0,479,4142.172,4152.752,The poor people can of they drop out they can't buy the thing at the end exalted price so you've got a way of Distributing the shortage it goes to the people with the most money.,0.91,100
0,480,4153.1,4159.342,At this point most human beings confronted with this explanation of a market.,0.91,100
0,481,4159.645,4165.787,Would turn against it because it contradicts their Christian judaic Islamic all of them.,0.87,100
0,482,4166.001,4173.538,What's what you know what that means it means that a rich person can get the scarce milk and give it to their cat.,0.8300000000000001,100
0,483,4173.688,4188.041,While the poor foot person has no milk for their five children there it is you want to Market why do the fundamental thing that seems unfair there's the resulting inequality now or death.,0.89,100
0,484,4188.299,4193.226,Or death well that's the ultimate inequality yes it is what about.,0.86,100
0,485,4193.673,4206.928,We're going to jump around from the philosophical from the economics to the sort of debate type of thing what about sort of the lifting ties raise all boats meaning.,0.91,101
0,486,4207.24,4210.268,If we look at the 20th century right.,0.88,101
0,487,4210.859,4220.26,A lot of people maybe you disagree with this but they attribute a lot of the Innovation and the average Improvement in the quality of life,0.85,102
0,488,4220.149,4226.174,to capitalism to inventions and Innovation to engineering.,0.84,102
0,489,4226.252,4240.938,And science developments that resulted from competition and all those kinds of forces so not looking at the individual unfairness of exploitation as its.,0.91,102
0,490,4241.043,4252.965,Specifically defined but just observing historically looking at 20th Century we came up with a lot of cool stuff that seemed to have made life easier and better on average.,0.91,102
0,491,4253.188,4262.166,What do you say that I have several responses to that but I do disagree pretty far fundamentally,0.91,103
0,492,4262.046,4272.887,with what's going on there but let me give you the argument so you that you can hear them and then you can evaluate them as can anybody who's listening or watching,0.86,103
0,493,4276.242,4288.542,Marx was a student of Hegel and one of hegel's central arguments was that everything that exists exists quote in the contradiction in simple English.,0.91,103
0,494,4288.63,4291.279,There's a good and bad side if you like to everything,0.87,103
0,495,4291.213,4302.748,and you won't understand it unless you accept that proposition and start looking for the good things that are the other side of the bad ones and the bad things that are the other side of the good ones Etc,0.88,103
0,496,4302.61,4307.888,so the dialectic yes exactly and marks very attentive to that.,0.81,103
0,497,4308.218,4316.9,"Explicitly agrees with this on many occasions and applies it of course to the central object of his research,",0.91,104
0,498,4316.95,4324.344,capitalism so this is not a simple minded fellow who's telling you all the bad things about capitalism,0.84,104
0,499,4324.197,4332.392,as if there were nothing that this system achieved or accomplished and one of the things he celebrates a lot is.,0.91,104
0,500,4332.516,4338.559,The technological dynamism of the system which marks takes to be,0.87,104
0,501,4338.448,4349.209,profound because you know he lived at the time when major breakthroughs in textile technology and Mining in chemistry and so on were achieved,0.87,104
0,502,4349.188,4358.913,but as to the notion that that capitalism is therefore responsible for the Improvement in,0.91,104
0,503,4358.775,4366.862,in the quality or the standard of living of the mass of people marks time comes back and says oh wait a minute here,0.77,104
0,504,4366.805,4371.912,number one capitalism as a system.,0.84,104
0,505,4372.288,4379.366,Has been mostly represented by capitalists which makes a certain sense.,0.91,105
0,506,4379.606,4393.077,And those capitalists with very few exceptions some but very few have fought against every effort to improve the lives of the mass of people.,0.91,105

0,508,4397.07,4405.248,what that means is replace a worker with a machine move the production from expensive u.s. to cheap China,0.84,105
0,509,4405.1,4420.669,bring in Desperate immigrants from other parts of the world because they will work for less money than the folks that you have here at home every measure to help the standard of living of American workers had to be fought for for,0.89,105
0,510,4420.512,4426.07,decades over the opposition of capitalists from the beginning.,0.85,105
0,511,4426.193,4438.844,To right now the reason we have a minimum wage which was passed 19 middle of the 1930s when it was proposed it was blocked by capitalists they got together they don't and today.,0.88,105
0,512,4438.922,4441.292,Just a factoid for you.,0.91,105
0,513,4441.911,4456.147,The last time the minimum wage was raised in United States federal minimum wage was in 2009 when it was set at the lofty some of $7.25 an hour.,0.77,106

0,516,4472.905,4478.769,During that time that the prices went up the minimum wage was never raised.,0.91,107
0,517,4479.387,4487.51,What this is a time of stock market boom of growing inequality this is a sister you know.,0.91,108
0,518,4489.848,4503.31,The nerve of the defender of capitalists who wants now to get credit for the Improvement in the standard of life of the workers that was fought by every generation.,0.91,109
0,519,4503.405,4510.529,You know what takes your breath away and it's an argument whoa but I take my hat off if I had one.,0.81,109
0,520,4510.67,4514.985,Because that is one of the only ways to justify this system.,0.91,109
0,521,4515.306,4522.745,Long ago let me get it the heart of it long ago capitalism could have.,0.91,109
0,522,4524.011,4531.046,Overcome hunger could have overcome disease could have be Way Beyond what we have now.,0.86,110
0,523,4531.762,4540.344,But it didn't and that's the worst moral condemnation imagine how do you justify.,0.78,111
0,524,4540.846,4549.581,That one you could you didn't look I let me get at it another way because just me may I interest you anyway.,0.89,111
0,525,4550.514,4562.598,The issue is not that capitalism isn't technologically Dynamic it is and along the way it has developed things that have helped people's lives get better no.,0.91,112
0,526,4562.694,4575.381,But the notion that the mass enjoyment of a rising standard of living is somehow built into capitalism is factually nuts and.,0.91,112
0,527,4575.721,4583.69,Is such an outrageous and I can give you a because you do math you'll understand it think of it this way.,0.8,112
0,528,4583.796,4587.903,Imagine a production process in which you have.,0.91,112
0,529,4588.333,4601.542,A hundred dollars that the capitalist has to lay out for tools equipment and raw materials and a hundred dollars that he has to lay out for workers hire the workers and he puts them all together and he has an output.,0.81,112
0,530,4601.854,4611.526,"And let's say the output is 100 units of something one of the prizes and that's his Revenue
and when he when he.",0.9,112
0,531,4612.342,4620.96,Takes his product and sells it and gets the revenue let's say the revenue is it doesn't really matter it's 120,0.91,113
0,532,4620.849,4629.53,for lack of a better word any take 220 sorry and he takes 100 of it and replaces the tools equipment and raw materials he used up.,0.91,113
0,533,4629.608,4639.162,Another 100 to hire the workers for the next shift and the other 20 is his prophet and he puts that aside now Along Comes A technological breakthrough.,0.74,113
0,534,4639.943,4644.933,A machine a new machine and the new machine is so effective.,0.88,114
0,535,4647.757,4657.005,You can get the same out the same number of units of output with half the workers so you don't need to spend a hundred on workers you only need to spend 50.,0.88,115
0,536,4657.578,4666.421,You can do it with half the workers and so the capitalist goes to the workers by the way this happens every day and he says to half of them you're fired.,0.9,116
0,537,4666.671,4672.426,Don't come back Monday morning I don't need you it's nothing personal it's just I got a machine,0.91,116
0,538,4672.423,4681.59,why does he do that because of the 50 he now no longer has to spend on labor because don't need half of them he keeps,0.89,116
0,539,4681.56,4693.671,everything else is the same the machine everything else is does it just to make the math easy so he he keeps as his own profit the 50 that before he paid for those workers.,0.88,116
0,540,4694.065,4701.999,"Because when he sells it for 220 that 50 don't have to give to the next job we could get in the machine
so that's what he does.",0.84,116
0,541,4702.391,4712.063,The technology leads he's happy he's become more profitable he's got an extra 50 which is why buys the machine.,0.91,116
0,542,4712.609,4720.948,The workers are screwed half of them just lost their job have to go home to their husband and wife,0.91,117
0,543,4720.747,4740.06,tell them I don't have a job anymore I didn't do anything wrong but the guy was nice enough to say he was not the wrong with me but he doesn't need them so I'm completely screwed here I don't know what I'm going to do about the decks we have the house on mortgage my children's education or whatever else is got going for himself right now,0.85,117
0,544,4739.868,4743.805,now the point there was of course an alternative path.,0.91,117
0,545,4744.261,4752.546,The alternative path would have been to keep all the workers pay them exactly the same that you did before for half a day's work.,0.91,117
0,546,4753.65,4761.035,He would have got the same output same Revenue same profit as before.,0.77,118

0,676,5926.295,5933.454,"we don't we're doing nothing to make that happen nothing well there's you know on,",0.91,145
0,677,5933.524,5940.953,"You could argue that autonomous vehicles is a kind of public transit because it's going to be reusable Vehicles it will end,",0.91,145
0,678,5940.977,5954.907,in theory car ownership so you just have a more kind of distributed public transit if it happens but you know that that's a side effect his major goal and the major goal of the other companies that are busy,0.86,145
0,679,5954.706,5964.332,squeezing to get his share of the pie smaller so they have some for General Motors Toyota all of them are making electric cars though so,0.9,145
0,680,5964.329,5970.859,what they've done is they've replaced the individual car with fossil fuel with another individual car.,0.89,145
0,681,5971.45,5985.991,That's fucking nuts what are you doing what at one of the things they're doing but automation is also nothing but on the Elan side there's also hilariously named boring company yes which is working on tunnels which is actually expanding the.,0.8200000000000001,146
0,682,5986.196,5989.359,He's the the flexibility you might have,0.66,146
0,683,5989.23,5998.163,to start playing with ideas of public transit I think listen I'm now partially living in Austin Texas that I don't know if they know,0.8200000000000001,146
0,684,5998.07,6007.3,what a public transit system is period yes there's a most of American constructs yeah they're well there's this is an interesting so.,0.79,146
0,685,6007.55,6016.969,"The older that by the way footnote the older this city the more likely it has public transportation so you're saying Boston is the best example yes,",0.9,146
0,686,6017.002,6025.26,have you been able yeah of course you have a place in Boston with the street Railway Boston is your case study of how to do this,0.84,146
0,687,6025.239,6035.64,because they've been doing it all along New York's pretty good too there's a Trader yeah New York I would say is better than Boston because there's their technology also helps you out,0.8,146
0,688,6035.493,6043.633,to do the public transit better so it's almost like Boston's a little too old but yes I get your point but there is a.,0.87,146
0,689,6044.422,6054.094,The the Ford F-150 pickup truck symbolizes something about America and there is a practical nature to the fact,0.84,147
0,690,6053.902,6056.966,in order to do public transit in order to,0.71,147
0,691,6056.783,6071.081,do some of these things that you're talking about with the working-class there has to be a central planning component or there has to be a centralized component and America is very much.,0.8200000000000001,147
0,692,6071.376,6073.386,Based on the idea of.,0.91,147
0,693,6073.554,6082.847,At least in recent times while see from the founding of individualism of respecting individual Freedom are you worried that.,0.77,147
0,694,6083.186,6091.48,In order to bring some of these ideas of Marxism to life you would trample on individual freedoms.,0.89,147
0,695,6092.207,6096.27,For me both sure for me Marxism is,0.91,148
0,696,6096.176,6107.441,a way to enhance the individual freedom of the mass of people who have had that freedom eroded under the capitalist oh that's a motive for my Marxism.,0.86,148
0,697,6107.538,6121.125,"It was for Mark's to heal of the French Revolution he loved the liberte egalite a fraternity the great three and then democracy the American contribution if you like he believed in all of that,",0.81,148
0,698,6121.149,6124.572,his critique of capitalism was it promised it.,0.91,148
0,699,6125.011,6131.864,And then never delivered it and the reason you have to go beyond it is because it didn't deliver what it had.,0.91,148
0,700,6132.194,6138.157,Promise of for me it is the Fulfillment of.,0.76,148
0,701,6138.721,6144.036,Of a genuine but again I'm a galleon marks so if you want.,0.8200000000000001,149
0,702,6144.798,6152.704,Individualism for me is not the way it's set up in this Society some sort of antithesis.,0.91,150
0,703,6153.332,6162.499,To the government I think an immense Khan has been pulled on the American people and the con works like this.,0.84,151
0,704,6163.324,6166.1,You know what's bad and what's dangerous and threatens you.,0.91,152
0,705,6166.35,6178.749,It's the government the government is going to come in and tell you what to do the government's going to run your life the government's the problem there really is no other way to explain the following in American politics.,0.91,152
0,706,6179.025,6186.139,Large numbers of people lose their homes in a downturn like the so-called Great Recession of 2008.,0.91,152
0,707,6186.47,6194.592,Who do they blame the government large numbers of people go unemployed and what is the media all about the government.,0.91,152
0,708,6195.391,6204.72,If I were a capitalist I'd love this I kicked the workers by throwing them out of their home and they don't get angry with me beginning with the government.,0.9,153
0,709,6205.077,6213.794,Fire large numbers of people I have no responsibility for what happens to them as a result of having no job and no income and they get angry at the senator.,0.8300000000000001,153
0,710,6214.305,6223.049,I'm laughing all the way to the bank this is a genius stroke in theory but there is if you look at government.,0.89,153
0,711,6223.199,6233.428,Because you said accountability in the capitalist system has no accountability there's some pushback I gave on the accountability I think there's some accountability we can discuss in a hegelian wait who.,0.86,153
0,712,6233.515,6239.774,There's more accountability for I would say that in theory government is,0.8300000000000001,153
0,713,6239.726,6249.479,perfectly accountable as the whole point of a democratic system is you vote people in English practice right there's a giant growing bureaucracy,0.73,153
0,714,6249.458,6254.124,that is accountable only on the surface there's two parties.,0.91,153
0,715,6254.301,6267.61,"That Seymour the same are the same media somehow integrated into making the the same two parties as just wearing different colored shirts or to seem like they're very,",0.81,153
0,716,6267.652,6277.143,opposed in are arguing and bitterly arguing the calling each other's as far as nice nasty names and all those kinds of things okay but that's government.,0.81,153
0,717,6277.654,6286.146,So what exactly is worst I had government or companies why are we asking that question.,0.87,154
0,718,6286.377,6293.302,These are the twins look what you were what you were able to say about Republicans and Democrats just out with which I agree.,0.85,154
0,719,6293.659,6301.179,I would say the same thing about corporations and the government this is the same people literally let's go to Churchill which one is the,0.91,154
0,720,6301.095,6309.957,which one is course let's go to church or like democracy is the worst form of government except all the other ones or whatever so this kind of same idea,0.81,154
0,721,6309.944,6320.363,which one exactly is worse because to me it seems like which one between what a government and Industry and companies it's because government.,0.91,154
0,722,6320.459,6327.745,Plagued by I will call it corruption because the corruption of.,0.79,154
0,723,6327.985,6336.441,Bureaucratic paperwork and then because it but they're not account there doesn't seem to be a serious accountability again.,0.77,154
0,724,6336.744,6345.164,Will not see we're not living on the same Planet the greatest practitioners of central planning our corporations.,0.74,154
0,725,6346.124,6353.662,Ilan has an operation like General Motors Ford IBM or any of the other Mega corpse.,0.8200000000000001,155
0,726,6353.849,6358.19,They have to plan they buy up companies,0.9,155
0,727,6358.115,6371.1,because they don't want to deal with in the market they don't want the insecurity the uncertainty of having to buy their inputs or sell their outputs to somebody they don't control.,0.89,155
0,728,6371.331,6375.844,They want the professor to teach the genius of a market they hate,0.91,155
0,729,6375.67,6388.933,the market and when they grow to be big they keep buying whoever they were dealing with before so they could better control them which requires them then to plan the production and distribution of goods,0.91,155
0,730,6388.796,6392.363,inside rather than buying them in the market.,0.91,155
0,731,6393.008,6402.32,The model of the government is it a private Corporation I have spent my life give you an example in American universities.,0.91,156
0,732,6402.443,6416.12,Big ones famous were not just as a student but as a professor I have a dozen school I teach now at the new school here is another one right they will model themselves after businesses they model the.,0.79,157
0,733,6416.189,6425.699,You can attack the bureaucracy of universities good reason that mess but they're proudly modeling themselves,0.9,158
0,734,6425.605,6438.022,on organizing their bill bureaucracy in a businesslike manner uh-huh so you're looking at a difference which isn't there the government and the private sector,0.77,158
0,735,6437.975,6444.423,our partners and both of them wouldn't have it any other way the corporations want that,0.87,158
0,736,6444.276,6458.737,from the government and the government now knows that the please the corporation's is the number-one objective they have because that's how they keep their jobs and keep their system going and so for all practical purposes,0.8300000000000001,158
0,737,6458.608,6464.84,this is this is the same people but there's a important differences that,0.84,158
0,738,6464.757,6476.337,I don't know if they're fundamental or just consequence of history but if you have government they're accountable in a different way than companies companies are accountable by especially if you have a,0.85,158
0,739,6476.243,6488.192,consumer they're accountable by sort of consumer spending or not spending their money on whatever the heck the company is selling the government is accountable by votes,0.85,158
0,740,6488.136,6495.583,and it seems like government unlike companies for most of companies history.,0.86,158
0,741,6495.94,6505.962,Is always too big to fail meaning it can always just print money it can always save itself and that creates a bureaucracy you never.,0.91,159
0,742,6506.068,6514.11,You rarely pay the cost of having made bad decisions if you're in government you distribute the blame.,0.91,159
0,743,6514.692,6524.49,And it's very unclear who's responsible for bad decisions so bad decisions and government accumulate so you become more and more and more inefficient and.,0.9,160
0,744,6524.613,6539.109,More and more poor in your decision-making terms of you said public transit should we build a public transit system in this city or not that's a difficult decision that's an interesting decision I would say it's very often very good decision.,0.91,160
0,745,6539.286,6548.76,"But whoever makes that decision should be accountable for a good or bad decision and it seems like companies are more accountable they pay,",0.88,160
0,746,6548.775,6551.127,they feel the pain,0.84,160
0,747,6551.106,6565.684,of having made a bad decision more because it can go bankrupt they I mean there's much more day-to-day pressure to make good engineering decisions government doesn't seem to be under the same level of pressure.,0.91,160
0,748,6565.951,6571.166,Is do you disagree with that I disagree with everything in my history.,0.8200000000000001,160
0,749,6571.352,6583.328,Pushes me you may be living I may be living a different who knows a planet or taking a different sort of drug I won't I won't mention the name but.,0.89,160
0,750,6583.965,6592.834,I personally had a lot to do with a very large company here in the United States here in the New York area and.,0.78,161
0,751,6595.694,6605.194,It involved two brothers and a family who built it up into a huge corporation one of the brothers was.,0.91,162
0,752,6606.119,6609.732,"Kind of the Dynamo
of the family.",0.88,163
0,753,6610.044,6619.977,"And he was more responsible anybody else building it up
but he took care of his brothers he had a nice feeling about his brother so the one brother who could not.",0.88,163
0,754,6620.568,6626.08,You know without help tie his shoes became a vice president.,0.9,164
0,755,6626.221,6637.342,Got an enormous salary got a beautiful office in a skyscraper not that many blocks from where I'm sitting right now and.,0.91,164
0,756,6637.519,6642.167,That was the way that family handle that company.,0.89,164
0,757,6642.452,6650.611,And all of his relatives that were somewhere in this company doing a variety of whatever because.,0.91,164
0,758,6650.717,6653.456,And my experience with this.,0.91,164
0,759,6654.056,6663.809,And because I went to the school's I told you all my experiences with that group of people corporate has a full of those stories you know.,0.79,165
0,760,6664.715,6672.109,They made mistake after mistake which they were told you what didn't-didn't undermined there they were always able,0.77,166
0,761,6672.025,6685.081,to blame somebody else something else that's great them through and had they not been able to they would have been replaced by another person who did the same thing for as long as they could.,0.91,166
0,762,6685.528,6691.121,And they knew it they would talk about it at family of that's how I know.,0.91,166
0,763,6691.605,6697.225,Yeah that's I mean I understand that you want the outside world to look at it this way but.,0.79,166
0,764,6697.474,6707.19,Well my experience interest but again what's that kind of thing the risk of saying human nature again I wonder what.,0.8,166
0,765,6707.628,6709.675,"Kind of system,",0.91,167
0,766,6709.717,6718.849,alas for that more versus versus less this is the question of the I will call that let's put that under the umbrella term of corruption,0.91,167
0,767,6718.837,6732.028,"which system allows for more corruption remember that the way I defined the different system is not more or less government it's more or less allowing a democratic workplace yeah reconfiguring it what what happens,",0.87,167
0,768,6732.051,6737.42,"when everybody
Matt has a vote when you have to explain.",0.8300000000000001,167
0,769,6737.741,6749.681,What the strategies are what the alternatives are to a larger number of people than a board of directors or a major shareholders or whoever it is that most companies are responsible to,0.85,168
0,770,6749.453,6758.944,and now you've got a whole different Universe it's not a small group of people can't be hidden the way it's normally hidden most of it and on and on and on,0.89,168
0,771,6758.725,6767.982,this is you know worker coops is what this is called in many parts of the world so it's not that I'm advocating something that's never been seen before not at all,0.91,168
0,772,6767.809,6771.476,"the Marxism I understand is too,",0.72,168
0,773,6771.517,6777.894,pick from historical precedence the things that we think will work,0.77,168
0,774,6777.864,6792.613,better and I think if all the people in an Enterprise just to drive the point home democratically decided they would never give two or three individuals a hundred million dollars while everybody else can send their kids to college a that can do that,0.85,168
0,775,6792.52,6797.51,so just to return this to address this.,0.85,168
0,776,6797.832,6806.0,Point about the particular implementation of Marxism that was the early days but in the Soviet Union why did.,0.75,169
0,777,6806.212,6815.721,Stalinism for example lead to so much Bloodshed do you think and human suffering is there any elements within the ideas of Marxism.,0.8200000000000001,169
0,778,6815.845,6817.963,That catalyzed.,0.76,169
0,779,6819.301,6826.272,The kind of government the kind of system that led to that bloodshed.,0.91,170
0,780,6826.359,6834.717,I don't think so I think there are many things that led to the Bloodshed and so all that Stalin's regimes did and.,0.79,170
0,781,6834.993,6842.692,You know I spent 10 years of my life with another Economist writing a book,0.8300000000000001,170
0,782,6842.573,6853.46,about that to try to explain from a Marxist position the rise and fall of the Soviet Union you mean you might want to take a look at it sometime but,0.84,170
0,783,6853.349,6860.985,"there I'm going to say a few things now but all of those things are spelled out in great detail with loads of empirical,",0.76,170
0,784,6861.0,6870.618,evidence at cetera in that in that work let me start with you know playing a little bit with with Hegel.,0.76,170
0,785,6872.244,6876.451,The biggest impact that Marxism had,0.88,171
0,786,6876.448,6884.499,"on the Soviet Union was really not so much what the Soviet Union did but what the rest of the world did,",0.81,171
0,787,6884.523,6893.538,you had a really interesting move and I'll give you a parallel sometime today the move was.,0.87,171
0,788,6894.587,6903.314,That the old Russian regime collapsed World War 1 just it fell apart there's our and all of that,0.73,172
0,789,6903.23,6915.764,it couldn't it couldn't survive it already been in trouble there was a revolution 1905 there was the loss of the war to Japan and then if you know Russian history which I assume you do,0.87,172
0,790,6915.617,6922.219,you'll know that there was a lot leading up to the collapse in 1917,0.91,172
0,791,6922.081,6926.512,and in some ways it was fortuitous that the.,0.91,172
0,792,6926.663,6934.588,Political group very small that could seize the opportunity of that collapse happened to be marxists.,0.9,172
0,793,6934.675,6939.791,You know earlier on with kerensky the first government that tried,0.88,172
0,794,6939.761,6951.188,it wasn't people all that impressed by Marxism label people more skeptical and would not have been called Marxist probably in by history they couldn't they try,0.87,172
0,795,6951.077,6958.516,they couldn't Lenin and his associates the were able to take over from them later in that same year.,0.8,172
0,796,6959.089,6961.199,The rest of the world though was horrified.,0.91,173
0,797,6961.753,6971.614,The rest of the world saw Marxism having taken this immense leap from being a political party of movement.,0.84,173
0,798,6971.908,6980.878,Critical of capitalism yes but still not challenging the power now it had the power and in a big country.,0.8300000000000001,173
0,799,6981.297,6982.507,And they freaked out.,0.91,173
0,800,6983.368,6991.401,If you know American history this country the leadership of this country went completely berserk I mean we had,0.91,174
0,801,6991.353,7004.832,repression of the left the likes of which we had not seen before sat the 20s were a time of Palmer Raids in Boston the sacko Vanzetti trials and he really,0.89,174
0,802,7004.811,7014.492,Grim hostility and you had the four countries agreeing to invade the Soviet Union to try to crush the revolution the US.,0.8300000000000001,174

0,914,7955.649,7970.532,Otherwise you would never have thought he'd call Hitler nasty names before the Prussian aristocracy looked down on Hitler as in Austin little funny man with a mustache who was Austria wasn't in German you know the mood for them that mattered so,0.8300000000000001,190
0,915,7970.493,7978.913,he comes in as the enemy the Smasher of socialism and communism which he immediately does.,0.85,190
0,916,7980.585,7992.768,Only people who don't know or care about the history pick up on the word you know it's like there are people here in the United States who like to say.,0.9,191
0,917,7993.801,8001.302,We are not a democracy we are Republic which is like saying I'm not a banana I'm a fruit,0.85,192
0,918,8001.245,8009.45,you have to explain to these people bananas so you have to explain the people yes we were Republic,0.86,192
0,919,8009.447,8021.999,but we have a commitment to democracy as a way to govern the Republic because the say you're Republic doesn't imply what kind of government you have to go through that with people so they kind of get as certain words,0.76,192
0,920,8021.923,8028.228,"have power beyond their actual meaning that used in communication whether it's negative,",0.8,192
0,921,8028.279,8038.419,like racist or positive like freedom of speech or democrat or double Daddy yeah and then you use that to mean something Wells or negative.,0.89,192

0,923,8039.658,8052.796,Donnie stop being a socialist are some whatever whatever that means that's not even use doesn't any kind of philosophical or economic sense so let's fast forward to today right you mentioned Bernie Sanders right,0.77,193
0,924,8052.649,8061.798,there's another popular figure that represents some of ideas of maybe let's call it Democratic socialism and maybe let's try to start,0.8,193
0,925,8061.686,8069.71,that sneak up on a definition of what that could possibly mean but AOC Alexandria Ocasio Cortez she's from,0.9,193
0,926,8069.663,8078.064,these parts yes greens so maybe if you can comment on Bernie Sanders or ALC,0.91,193
0,927,8078.053,8086.977,are they open to some ideas and Marxism are they representing those ideas well in both the economic and the political sense.,0.87,193
0,928,8088.369,8089.983,Okay.,0.91,194
0,929,8090.791,8101.678,Where do I begin yeah the social the Socialist movement predates marks was always larger than marks and has gone on to develop.,0.76,195
0,930,8101.765,8108.321,Separately after marks is death so can we pause on that actually King is there a nice way to,0.68,195
0,931,8108.292,8117.126,to delineate draw a line between Marxism and Socialism or or if Marxism is kind of a part of socialism.,0.9,195
0,932,8117.284,8125.704,That's been he can you speak to like maybe the try to Define once again what Marxism is and what socialism is right.,0.6900000000000001,195
0,933,8125.864,8131.538,Marxism is a systematic analysis.,0.89,195
0,934,8131.886,8141.882,Heavily focused on economics and as I said earlier devoted to mostly a critique.,0.91,195
0,935,8142.185,8147.707,"Of capitalism
and that's its strength.",0.91,195
0,936,8148.127,8159.58,How it does that how it poses the questions how it analyzes the way capitalism works that is really the Forte of the Marxist tradition.,0.9,196
0,937,8159.658,8165.242,Socialism is a bigger broader tent within which Marxism.,0.84,196
0,938,8165.519,8178.404,Figures it's there so that people who aren't Marxist or nonetheless aware of Marxism like it more or less study it more or less but it's a broader notion,0.8300000000000001,196
0,939,8178.374,8188.261,that I like to use this sentence to describe it's a broad idea that we can do better than some than capitalism and really,0.9,196
0,940,8188.231,8197.597,there are all kinds of things about capitalism that are not what we as modern citizens of the world.,0.91,196
0,941,8197.927,8201.711,Think are adequate that we are in a tradition.,0.8200000000000001,196
0,942,8202.05,8208.958,That goes back to all the people who thought they could do better than slavery and all the people who thought they could do better than feudalism.,0.91,197
0,943,8209.234,8213.918,We've made progress feudalism was a progress over slavery.,0.91,197
0,944,8214.158,8224.081,Capitalism was a progress over both of them and progress hasn't stopped and we are the people who in a variety of ways want.,0.91,197
0,945,8224.421,8225.891,The progress.,0.91,197
0,946,8226.077,8240.663,To go for the further and are not held back by believing that capitalism is somehow the best Beyond which we cannot go or even think we find that to be in the worst sense of the word.,0.91,197
0,947,8240.76,8245.534,A reactionary way of thinking and where that large,0.87,197
0,948,8245.441,8251.691,Community many of us are not interested in economics all that much we don't think that's,0.91,197
0,949,8251.644,8259.38,the focal area we are socialists for example because we want to do something to deal with,0.91,197
0,950,8259.323,8272.504,climate change to we think the world is about to kill itself physically and we want to take steps with other people to stop that to me to fix that etcetera etcetera.,0.9,197
0,951,8272.835,8280.805,So that's for me a kind of difference is a little difficult to say because there's no other figure.,0.88,197
0,952,8281.27,8284.703,Like marks that has an equal.,0.79,198
0,953,8285.141,8295.532,Impact an equal place within the broad socialist tradition and the only tradition that comes close might be,0.77,198
0,954,8295.458,8301.078,the anarchists tradition but that's very specialized and,0.89,198
0,955,8301.066,8314.978,that's a whole nother kind of conversation and whatever you say the influence of the great anarchists thinkers kropotkin bakunin sorell in France and others still doesn't amount.,0.87,198
0,956,8315.074,8324.294,To the impact that Marx and Marxism have had so far that could change but I mean up to this point that's the.,0.73,198

0,965,8387.092,8408.808,we want to create the conditions under which there is a will because you remember the the Communist so what did they weren't called that at first in Russia before the Revolution they were just socialists they were hunted down and persecuted by the government left and right they had no love for the government the government was their literal everyday enemy,0.8300000000000001,200
0,966,8408.607,8416.829,and being critical of government didn't just mean this particular government but of the whole.,0.9,200

0,968,8428.007,8442.215,especially because if you understand feudalism particularly early feudalism it didn't have powerful states one of Lenin's greatest books is called the economic history of Russia and he goes back centuries,0.88,200

0,989,8604.685,8615.419,And I would ask the question that had something to do with Marxism because I was studying it on my own that there were no courses to teach this to me except by people who trashed,0.81,203
0,990,8615.353,8621.838,you know that other than that and I didn't want that so I would ask a question.,0.86,203

0,1013,8804.761,8815.098,what does that mean what you like G she is a literary critic but they were and they didn't even know they don't even know it's been erased.,0.8,207
0,1014,8815.366,8818.294,It's a little bit like stories I've heard about,0.91,207
0,1015,8818.165,8832.455,Trotsky and his influence kind of erased in the Soviet Union because he obviously fell out of favor and so somehow all of his writings many of which are very interesting and complicated anyway so.,0.91,207
0,1016,8832.677,8836.155,What you going to have in this country is a slow.,0.81,207

0,1019,8855.948,8861.136,As have a lot of us that when it starts to happen it happens fast,0.91,208
0,1020,8861.106,8875.324,so the you see Bernie is an early sign of the Awakening absolutely for the corridor to accept the idea was always a social we all knew and everybody who paid attention he didn't I did.,0.8300000000000001,208

0,1025,8911.942,8922.765,But the great question and I don't mind telling you because I went to the right schools I know a lot of people in the you know Janet Yellen was my classmate at Yale and stuff like that.,0.9,209
0,1026,8922.97,8930.967,So I was speaking with a high official of the democratic party and I said well what do you think about Bernie entering the race.,0.8300000000000001,209
0,1027,8931.369,8939.285,Makes no difference if they get one percent of the vote all right he was wrong yeah they had no idea what was coming,0.6900000000000001,209
0,1028,8939.228,8945.64,but the truth is I didn't either it wasn't just that he didn't get it I thought his 1% was probably right,0.89,209
0,1029,8945.592,8951.771,so we were both wrong yeah change can happen fast do you think AOC might be president one day yeah.,0.87,209

0,1033,8977.325,8992.875,you can imagine so not a OCR Bernie no no they are not confrontational in my judgment in terms of the ideas of socialism yeah I mean they're both very feisty they're feisty personally but not but not ideologically gotta you know she is.,0.9,210
0,1034,8993.124,8995.117,Bernie is also.,0.78,210
0,1035,8995.582,9003.291,You know in honest moments and they're both really are pretty honest Folks at least in my experience.,0.89,210
0,1036,9004.206,9017.523,In honest moments Bernie will tell you that his what he Advocates his Democratic socialism is pretty much what FDR was in the 1930s it was a kind of popular government.,0.84,211
0,1037,9017.664,9025.697,Tax the rich a lot more than you do now to provide a lot more support for the working class than you do now,0.91,211
0,1038,9025.55,9037.148,that's not a fundamental change that's what he means by socialism when he talks about it and he's asked for examples he mentions Denmark a lot okay that,0.91,211
0,1039,9037.028,9046.475,that that's consistent that's the softest kind of socialism and that's where we're going to start in a country coming out of hibernation.,0.91,211

0,1041,9049.028,9059.654,they'll be people who need and want to go further in the direction of socialism then Bernie and AOC are comfortable with you can already see that the shoots of it now.,0.87,211
0,1042,9059.822,9066.442,You know AOC voted together with most of the others to support the money for Ukraine.,0.81,211
0,1043,9066.817,9075.588,Okay that a lot of people in the in the Socialist movement do not support that and that's going to happen I don't know exactly how that's going to work out but.,0.85,211

1,43,387.12,401.2,Music.,,13
1,44,401.045,410.941,You've written on your website that quote I prefer listening to talking reading to socializing and cozy chats to group settings.,0.86,14
1,45,411.398,420.691,So I think this conversation in the podcast is going to be fun what's a good definition of an introvert is something like those three things a good start.,0.91,14
1,46,421.327,430.008,It is a good start in terms of how introverts experience day-to-day life I think a good definition is one that.,0.91,14
1,47,430.212,438.191,"Some of your listeners will have heard many times before you know the idea of where do you get your energy and for some people they get their energy more from,",0.91,14
1,48,438.332,442.404,quieter settings and for other people they get it more from being out there.,0.89,14
1,49,442.654,452.145,So A good rule of thumb is to ask to imagine that you're at a party that you're really enjoying and you've been there for about two hours or so and it's with people you really like.,0.8,14
1,50,452.385,455.809,And it's your favorite place it's all good.,0.87,14
1,51,456.157,466.756,An extrovert in a setting like that is going to feel charged up and they're going to be looking for the after-party and an introvert no matter how good a time they're having and how socially skilled they are.,0.86,15
1,52,466.942,471.527,There's this moment where you just like wish that you could teleport and be back at home.,0.91,15
1,53,471.74,481.681,"Yeah and that the time before the start of the party to the time when that moment happens is different for different people so like the shorter that is the more of a niche where you are is that that kind of thing,",0.86,15
1,54,481.777,491.08,the shorter the moment until you get to the place where you got a Teleport oh yeah yeah and then for extroverts it's the opposite right like they're going to feel.,0.84,15
1,55,491.248,502.035,Maybe they're working on I don't know like focused on producing a memo that's really intensely interesting to them but if they're in that state of like solitary.,0.8300000000000001,15
1,56,502.366,513.378,"The solitary mode of really focusing they might get stir-crazy a lot faster than an introvert would and so it doesn't have so much to do with what you're good at as how you get your energy,",0.91,16
1,57,513.501,524.028,"and so for an introvert the source of energy is what silence Solitude and for an extrovert its interaction with other people,",0.9,16
1,58,524.187,534.705,"what I'd really say is that and this is neurobiological as well is that it has to do with how your nervous system reacts to stimulation so for an introvert,",0.78,16
1,59,534.864,540.403,you're feeling in a great state of equilibrium when there are fewer inputs coming at you.,0.89,16
1,60,540.58,549.765,So they could be social inputs but that's why an introvert in general would rather hang out with one close friend at a time as opposed to you big party full of strangers because.,0.9,16
1,61,550.123,559.47,Too many inputs for the nervous system and for an extrovert the nervous system needs more stimulants so if they're not getting enough they get that listless and sluggish feeling.,0.88,17
1,62,559.656,567.716,So if you're just walking through the world like a people listening to this but in general how do you know if you're an introvert.,0.74,17
1,63,568.298,574.441,Like how do you empirically start to determine if you are in large part and introvert.,0.89,17
1,64,575.509,590.006,I would start by just asking that question of what happens to you you know it around the two-hour Mark where you're having a good time yeah like I mean imagined but I also find curious if you have a different experience from this but from all the years that I've been out there,0.8300000000000001,18
1,65,589.958,592.004,talking about this topic I found that.,0.91,18
1,66,592.289,601.826,"Most people really seem to know once they're being honest with themselves and maybe that's the question to ask is like if you imagine that you have,",0.88,18
1,67,601.976,611.062,"a Saturday or a whole weekend where you can spend your time exactly the way you want to with no professional obligations and no social obligations,",0.8,18
1,68,611.176,619.389,who would you spend it with how many people what would you be doing and what is that picture that you're painting start to look like.,0.91,18
1,69,619.773,626.843,Yeah so there's Nuance to this though because I'm sure for extroverts to get energized by.,0.88,18
1,70,627.083,638.987,Stimulation whether a stimulation with other people like it depends what that stimulation is right like maybe you're not surrounded by the kind of people that you enjoy being around so you know.,0.91,18
1,71,639.515,640.481,Um,0.73,19
1,72,640.838,650.042,Maybe that has to do less with whether some characteristics is your personality more has to do with the fact that like what your environment is like that's always kind of,0.85,19
1,73,649.985,659.989,the question do you want to be alone because everybody around you is an ass hole or do you want to be alone because you get energized from being well I would hold the variables constant I guess okay,0.91,19
1,74,659.968,667.803,you know you pass was constant and c and then there's the other thing you kind of observe that there's a lot of people.,0.85,19
1,75,668.367,672.232,They will say they get energized from being alone like.,0.8300000000000001,20
1,76,672.625,681.09,People are exhausting to them or something like that but at the same time when you see them at a party they seem like the life of the party.,0.87,20
1,77,681.664,694.603,I know and I hear from those people all the time there's so many people like what would you classify them as exactly is It ultimately is the source of energy is the most important thing or like how the heck are they the life of the party.,0.84,21
1,78,694.996,699.581,It's a bunch of different things you know so first of all just to say like a big,0.68,21
1,79,699.533,714.498,"caveat to all of this is humans are just amazingly complex so you can't like explain every individual human through these parameters even though I think the parameters are really valuable but that person at the party it could be that,",0.89,21
1,80,714.63,726.921,they're more of an ambivert so they kind of in the middle of the spectrum that's it basically means someone who's not extremely introverted or extremely extroverted they're kind of in the middle so maybe at a party there more extroverted side comes out,0.9,21
1,81,726.9,735.113,"or it could be an introvert who's gotten really good at the skills of acting more like a pseudo extrovert and they,",0.89,21
1,82,735.182,743.152,pull that up at the moment that they need it so that learn how to fake it yeah oh there's a lot of people like that and I know this because.,0.89,21
1,83,743.338,752.794,"Like I think out of all the people on this planet you could be talking to you I've heard from the most number of those people like they all they all come and tell me about their experience,",0.84,21
1,84,752.917,758.609,out in the world presenting a face that's different from what they feel so one of the things you talk about is.,0.91,21
1,85,758.966,763.461,At least in the west have constructed a picture of success and that picture.,0.8300000000000001,21
1,86,763.926,770.483,Is usually one of an extrovert like when you imagine somebody who's a leader who's a successful person.,0.91,21
1,87,771.092,778.054,That person has some of the qualities you would associate with an extrovert and so there's a lot of incentive.,0.91,22
1,88,778.366,787.236,For faking it yeah exactly you will if you want to be successful you gotta be able to fake it to sort of.,0.78,22
1,89,787.512,794.6,Hang with the rest of the team you have to have to be able to be outgoing and all those kinds of things and not be drained by the interaction.,0.8200000000000001,22
1,90,794.813,802.603,Yeah but I mean there are also a lot of introverts who figure out ways to draw on their own strengths and their incredibly.,0.8300000000000001,22
1,91,802.789,810.957,"Connecting and successful and they're great leaders and they're not actually faking it they're more just figuring out ways to do it their own way,",0.91,22
1,92,811.107,812.866,you see a lot of people like that.,0.85,22
1,93,813.736,821.346,Is there advice is there lessons you can draw from that from just observing how you can be an introvert and be in a leadership position.,0.68,23
1,94,821.541,829.124,Yeah it's kind of like a mantra figuring out what your own strengths are and how to draw on them I think of.,0.9,23
1,95,829.535,841.745,A guy I know Doug Conant who had been the CEO of Campbell Soup for many years he's very introverted he's quite shy also by his own just description and.,0.91,23
1,96,841.931,846.831,And he really cares about people and so when he started.,0.91,23
1,97,847.53,859.443,Campbell the employee engagement ratings of the company where all the way at the bottom of the Fortune 500 and by the time he stepped down ten years later they were all the way at the top and.,0.72,24
1,98,860.251,873.892,He was it wasn't that he was going out there and schmoozing people but he really did care so he would find out who are the people who had really been contributing and he would write to them personal letters of thanks.,0.91,25
1,99,874.168,875.359,"And,",0.91,26
1,100,875.384,885.658,"and people and these letters meant so much to people they would like carry them around with them and during his time the 10 years there he wrote 30,000 of those letters",0.89,26
1,101,885.655,899.36,"so like that was his way of doing it that was his way of drawing and his own strength and and you know what like he did that together was of course you sometimes have to go outside your comfort zone no matter who you are so he was doing plenty of that too yeah it's kind of combination,",0.84,26
1,102,899.492,905.058,"yeah that the writing process and focusing on the one-on-one interaction,",0.88,26
1,103,905.109,917.706,I can definitely relate there's something deeply draining which concerns me about like Zoom meetings because it's some weird brain manipulation it's a more well because you're not really engaged.,0.8300000000000001,26
1,104,917.919,926.96,"But it wears on you the same way that it does a party it feels like you're emptying that bucket for the introverts,",0.91,26
1,105,927.066,934.837,even though they're not participating at all in the meeting and I suppose that's true for physical meetings to but with zoom meetings remote meetings,0.87,26
1,106,934.726,949.394,it's so much easier to invite a larger number of people into the meeting so you're draining more and more of the introvert energy and I'm probably X42 but the introvert definitely there's I mean it's interesting I I would love to understand that more because there's more and more push towards,0.84,26
1,107,949.382,950.474,remote work.,0.88,26
1,108,951.561,963.834,Without I think a deep understanding of why these meetings are so draining on people I just anecdotally have heard from that but maybe that's because the managers the people who arranged the meetings are just not.,0.81,27
1,109,964.281,975.483,Sufficiently yet aware of the draining nature of them so that they pull into many people this schedule them to regularly so they need to adjust that kind of thing probably I think people are starting to realize but.,0.8,27
1,110,976.11,979.867,I I would say one reason that steam is so draining is because.,0.74,27
1,111,981.466,994.838,You can see your own self presentation the whole time if you choose to and when you go into in person you can't see your kind of freed of thinking about that all those books like an extra cognitive load that your bearing.,0.9,28
1,112,995.015,996.152,The whole time.,0.91,28
1,113,996.401,1007.549,"Oh yeah like you might want to you know turn off the camera so you can't see yourself but then you feel like well I have the ability to so I probably should be doing it and then that alone is it,",0.74,28
1,114,1007.627,1016.209,decision that you're making yeah there's probably studies on this now happening either have happened or are happening the effect of seeing your own.,0.74,28
1,115,1016.584,1024.743,Face on camera because it's reminding you're supposed to be acting a certain way and that's that is especially a stressful thing,0.84,29
1,116,1024.632,1035.096,yeah you can't be in the moment as much but I mean for you you you make the decision to do all your podcast interviews in person right and so and that's,0.9,29
1,117,1035.093,1041.271,even when it's very costly if there's any kind of chemistry that contributes at all.,0.81,29
1,118,1041.628,1053.865,To the conversation which I think most conversations have chemistry even the boring work meanings there's something there because yes you're trying to solve a particular problem with this particular time,0.8300000000000001,29
1,119,1053.862,1059.078,but underneath it there's a team building that's happening and honestly.,0.8300000000000001,29
1,120,1059.345,1063.957,"People also have told me about this why they enjoyed the zoo meetings during,",0.85,29
1,121,1064.107,1069.727,the pandemic is like they're lonely yeah like they.,0.91,29
1,122,1070.004,1080.863,You know it's annoying to have to sit and listen to folks talk about nothing and so on but they tune in anyway because it's kind of lonely to sit there by yourself and that.,0.86,29
1,123,1081.526,1092.278,I mean there's a deep connection there when you're with other people and that is especially true in there you were there in person which is a huge concern for me for like more and more offices.,0.71,30
1,124,1092.464,1107.114,From a capitalist perspective realizing hey why are we why do we have these large office spaces why do I have to get people together but I think in some in some deep sounds we do but then you also talk about that once we do we want to protect.,0.89,30
1,125,1107.687,1111.057,The introverts like you don't want the open.,0.91,30
1,126,1111.603,1122.832,Space which office space which was a big fad for a while I don't know where people stand on that at this point yeah I think people are figuring it out in a post pandemic context but I mean I know what you mean.,0.78,30
1,127,1123.342,1129.656,"So before I became a writer I was a corporate lawyer for like seven years and,",0.87,30
1,128,1129.815,1136.542,"literally the only thing I miss from those years is hanging out with people,",0.8300000000000001,30
1,129,1136.665,1142.169,at the office like I don't know just some of the funniest moments I've had in my life came from.,0.89,30
1,130,1142.931,1151.954,Being at the office until midnight with the other people I was working with so I know exactly what you're talking about so I will say the office is there at that firm and at most firms in those days,0.88,31
1,131,1151.816,1158.661,everybody had their own office so it was like a dorm room you know it was like a long hallway everybody in their own little dorm room,0.91,31
1,132,1158.658,1165.26,so you had tons of privacy but you would also come out and hang out with you so you can and I don't go home whenever you want.,0.8200000000000001,31
1,133,1165.743,1169.301,Yeah yeah and whenever you roam that means you're kind of open.,0.78,31
1,134,1169.785,1178.655,"You're looking for trouble yeah you're going for direction and the extent to which you would keep your door open you know was It Wide Open or was it half a jar just a little bit,",0.72,31
1,135,1178.796,1186.73,those are all signals so is there because you said re-energized is there do you like to think and again the human mind is complicated but,0.8300000000000001,31
1,136,1186.646,1193.716,"do you like to think of it as like a bucket that gets refilled for introverts in terms of energy of,",0.91,31
1,137,1193.803,1203.429,social interaction that that that the able to handle is do you think of it like that as a bucket that gets empty and needs to be refilled,0.7000000000000001,31
1,138,1203.309,1216.347,I think of it yeah more or less because I use the metaphor of a battery that can be recharged or not it's basically the same thing different metaphor but yeah but just to add on that there is a layer of complexity to that because.,0.87,31
1,139,1217.344,1219.615,You could be somebody who.,0.91,32
1,140,1220.476,1228.374,Doesn't want the kind of social life let's say where you have to be like on and presenting and interacting with tons of people all the time,0.87,33
1,141,1228.236,1235.738,"but you get really lonely if you were just by yourself you know so what you want is to maybe be in the company of a couple people you know really well,",0.91,33
1,142,1235.879,1249.899,like for me that pandemic was not actually that hard for me personally I mean I lost family but I mean from the point of view of what we're talking about it wasn't that hard because I live with my husband and my kids so I knew it was hard in the kids and,0.85,33
1,143,1249.869,1257.101,I felt badly for them but for me I was like you know what I kind of I have a lot of social life right here in the house,0.88,33
1,144,1256.945,1270.298,you may work yeah that's the cool thing about that but that pandemic I think it'd help people figure out how much they love their family that's true and and allow you give you a chance to really reconnect with kids,0.79,33
1,145,1270.178,1280.173,was your kids like really spend time with them it's just fascinating to watch people actually it did strengthen the family unit and and often beautiful.,0.8,33
1,146,1280.486,1290.922,"Way which is sucks the mitu to have to leave behind at this point yeah and I think that's part of what people are not going to want to go back to that we need to solve for,",0.8,33
1,147,1290.955,1300.69,to the extent that work becomes non remote again yeah I think people have just realized how precious those aspects of their lives are and you know for somebody who's in a.,0.91,33
1,148,1301.272,1309.935,Conventional office job where you're going home and seeing your kids for an hour before bedtime and that's your interaction with them that's.,0.91,34
1,149,1310.247,1324.528,"That's kind of a ridiculous way to set things up it's cool to you can get I think a lot of places give you the option now which is interesting you get to optimize that element of your life you take the commute in the office working on the social interaction there or do you focus on the work at home,",0.87,34
1,150,1324.606,1328.687,"it's also lonely at home but then you get to see your kids if you have kids,",0.8200000000000001,34
1,151,1328.729,1334.889,that's part of the optimization is like I have some options now and I'm going to try to optimize.,0.81,34
1,152,1335.742,1343.036,Solitude loneliness happiness productivity seeing family,0.84,35
1,153,1342.916,1357.62,seeing co-workers the chemistry with the team building with the co-workers versus just the the raw exchange of information with the co-workers it's fascinating to see how that how that kind of revolves yeah and then there's the big,0.75,35
1,154,1357.491,1358.817,"the third space,",0.91,35
1,155,1358.958,1373.059,idea of you know the spaces where you're in a co-working space or a cafe or something like that you've got other people around you but you're not exactly interacting with them but they're very much there and that's huge too,0.9,35
1,156,1373.029,1377.218,we and I don't think we think about that enough yeah that energy is there.,0.75,35
1,157,1377.386,1391.963,Yeah I lived in Manhattan for 17 years before we had kids and I absolutely loved it like I loved it the feeling of all that energy all around you but you could be anonymous within it.,0.85,35
1,158,1392.258,1400.633,It's me was perfect he has beautiful the guy I worked this morning for a few hours programmed for a few hours at a Starbucks and first of all.,0.66,35
1,159,1401.089,1409.14,"Like wearing wearing suits like Manhattan is the one place you can kind of fit into that because everyone's wearing suits even looked every day,",0.86,36
1,160,1409.281,1420.024,well these days unfortunate because I get recognized I wear usually not suits when I just on my own life but yeah I love it I love the way it feels I don't know,0.8,36
1,161,1419.904,1428.081,and the way I think about the world are aware so I take it seriously as if my life is going to end today like this is what I would want to wear,0.76,36
1,162,1428.015,1439.892,not for not physical appearance but just it for some reason makes me feel like focused I don't know so even if you're not going to see anyone you would still put the suit on when you're doing your work especially that really,0.87,36
1,163,1439.772,1441.188,especially then yeah.,0.89,36
1,164,1441.635,1452.342,Yeah I really I'd ever really loved doing that they're like tells you seriousness of purpose something like yeah like everything makes me do now I don't know what it is I don't know what I imagine exactly but if some kind of.,0.8300000000000001,36
1,165,1452.762,1458.697,Platonic form of like a mixture of James Bond and like.,0.88,36
1,166,1459.072,1468.312,I don't know who else Richard Fineman can I think about when I think about it suit you know I think of Leonard Cohen but you've always wearing skirts too but you know,0.85,36
1,167,1468.156,1481.455,Leonard Cohen is definitely one of my as a tragic human is a beautiful human being yeah there is words through his own private life yes I definitely would think about Leonard Cohen so.,0.88,36

1,169,1486.791,1496.093,is that part of the equation of introvert versus extrovert well how much people enjoy small talk I kind of went into this whole thing thinking that it was.,0.9,37
1,170,1496.945,1501.26,"From what I've seen most people have studies that most people don't like small talk,",0.88,38
1,171,1501.365,1516.051,I think that's why people like your podcasts because you're like I got the small talk I'm going deep into it from the very beginning yes it's actually the picture your painting is like the way you started like with your with the book quiet.,0.84,38
1,172,1516.606,1521.119,And the way you are today is you realize the picture may be more complicated.,0.87,38
1,173,1521.593,1529.959,Yeah everything is more complicated I will say with the small talk thing that.,0.66,38
1,174,1530.622,1540.312,"I'm curious if you have this experience but I find it fantastic to have a career where
I'm known for anti small talk.",0.85,39
1,175,1540.507,1549.755,Kinds of topics because it means that anywhere I go like if I show up at a conference or something like that no one does small talk with me they're like telling me about,0.91,39
1,176,1549.599,1559.019,"the Deep truth of their lives from the first hello and I love that and in normal life you have to Wade through a lot before you know if people are ready to go there,",0.84,39
1,177,1559.124,1567.589,yeah you have that experience to know definitely definitely would people that know me for sure but you forgot how many people feel like they know you.,0.8200000000000001,39
1,178,1567.964,1577.203,Because of your podcast that's what noise that counts but he's Fair podcast and I feel it like before I ever became friends with Joe Rogan.,0.74,40
1,179,1577.398,1582.523,I felt like I was friends with him because I was a fan of his podcast so like it was.,0.91,40
1,180,1582.71,1591.976,"I feel like it's a friendship I know it's a one-way friendship with all the people I listen to and podcasts and even people who are no longer with us like writers,",0.84,40
1,181,1592.099,1601.059,"I feel like I have a relationship with them maybe I'm insane no I totally feel that way that's the whole reason I became a writer like I'm friends with Leonard Cohen yeah,",0.84,40
1,182,1601.218,1610.8,"and he's not aware of it no I can't but I think that's the whole reason for writing or making music or whatever people do,",0.77,40
1,183,1610.869,1621.665,it's be able to have those kinds of connections that don't require having to be in a room together because there's only so many people you can be in a room with the in your lifetime.,0.89,40
1,184,1621.879,1629.641,The hard thing is is unfortunately because I value human connection so much.,0.91,40
1,185,1630.692,1636.042,And I only have just like you mentioned sort of small circle of people I'm really close with.,0.81,41
1,186,1636.534,1647.736,By design it always hurts me a lot to say goodbye to people hmm I can't uni people you can tell they're beautiful people they're amazing there's something so fascinating about them there are.,0.8300000000000001,41
1,187,1648.939,1657.981,They've had a complicated life that he could see in their eyes and the way they tell their story just a few sentences they've gone through some shit but they're also.,0.85,42
1,188,1658.302,1667.244,Found some elements of beauty and then you get the realize okay well there's a fascinating human here and all you get to say is a few words here and there like a.,0.88,42
1,189,1668.24,1674.14,Funny little joke maybe a dark joke here and there and then you just say goodbye maybe hug it out.,0.87,43
1,190,1674.524,1682.638,"And you go on your way so like that's a hello and a goodbye you paths will never cross again and that makes me like a sad walk,",0.87,43
1,191,1682.761,1696.852,fuck away but I guess I wouldn't have it any other way I suppose is the reality is in your book you talk about that sorrow that's sadness not being such a bad thing yeah and when you just said that.,0.8300000000000001,43
1,192,1697.083,1706.782,I just thought of this one moment in my life that I haven't thought of for 20-30 years or something but it was when I was in law school and.,0.84,43
1,193,1707.436,1716.756,"And a classmate of mine had his friend come to visit for the weekend and the three of us hung out a lot and we just had you know like an amazing time and,",0.88,44
1,194,1716.889,1722.968,"and then this other guy who wasn't going to be coming back anytime soon if at all sent a postcard to me,",0.91,44
1,195,1723.1,1732.096,and the only thing written on the postcard was this quote from Oscar Wilde and I don't remember the exact words but it basically said that there's no pain as intense as.,0.85,44
1,196,1732.282,1741.387,The sorrow of parting from someone to whom you've just been introduced yeah there's something so intense about that and so true.,0.91,44
1,197,1741.789,1747.4,I think partly also because when you've just been introduced to somebody you don't yet know.,0.8300000000000001,44
1,198,1748.009,1755.943,Their difficulties so you're seeing you're seeing the most sparkling version of them you're seeing like a platonic,0.91,44
1,199,1755.796,1766.485,version of love and friendship and your imagination fills in the rest and some some beautiful way that matches perfectly the kind of thing you're interested in is how I feel about one scoop like one.,0.88,44
1,200,1766.788,1776.216,Spoonful of ice cream and that's why you always finish the whole tub and you regret all of it you do you do say what did you write this.,0.88,44
1,201,1776.502,1783.463,I think this is on your website that one of the best things in the world is that Sublime moment when a writer artist or musician,0.9,44
1,202,1783.262,1794.284,manages to express something you've always felt but never articulated or at least never quite so beautifully so that's the Squall line is one line like that but just a line,0.87,44
1,203,1794.146,1795.463,from a song.,0.91,44
1,204,1796.145,1805.096,"Or maybe a piece of art that just grabs user something that jumps out into memory like that for you I don't know if I have an exact line though,",0.85,45
1,205,1805.102,1818.158,"I mean that feeling that you just quoted happens to me all the time I'm just bad at recalling exact instances that on the spot but the writer a lendable tongue regularly makes me feel that way,",0.91,45
1,206,1818.263,1826.701,he's just this beautiful essayist and like Observer of human nature and he's just constantly expressing things and this gorgeous way.,0.91,45
1,207,1827.355,1830.347,That you've experienced yourself and you feel like.,0.91,45
1,208,1830.515,1840.88,It's just this Grand Act of generosity you know you feel less lonely feel a deep sense of communion it's such an elevating experience even when it's like a Melancholy line.,0.88,45
1,209,1841.579,1847.226,Maybe especially when it is it what is that there's a.,0.89,46
1,210,1847.673,1861.396,So the Jack Kerouac on the road definitely makes me feel that way like every other line in their forlorn Rags of growing old you know I never read that book so what was it about that book that made you feel that way.,0.76,46
1,211,1862.113,1868.436,Well okay well since you asked I didn't tell you I'm going to linger on this.,0.71,47
1,212,1868.649,1878.374,So this is story is he's kind of the book The the kind of defining book of the of the beets be generation and.,0.81,47
1,213,1878.749,1885.603,"Basically story of a writer who takes a road trip across the United States a couple of times,",0.8200000000000001,47
1,214,1885.663,1894.074,and experiences a few close friends and a few strangers along the way and there's a lot of just those Melancholy goodbyes along the way,0.9,47
1,215,1894.035,1904.841,you meet all these people with interesting lives some of them are defined by struggle some of them are defined by drugs drinking women all that kind of stuff and still he just kind of,0.77,47
1,216,1904.748,1914.185,"dances around all of that and it's defined by the goodbyes and the passing of time so a lot of the really powerful lines are basically like,",0.84,47

1,282,2453.013,2463.81,Pain that any human has ever felt right or maybe even when you're younger and then one of the process one of the things you realize is that everybody goes through this,0.91,59
1,283,2463.716,2467.708,they can be an Awakening to the fact that we're all in this together,0.8,59
1,284,2467.588,2476.206,this Human Condition is not just a personal experience the experience who all share and that's that's the kind of love the unity of it,0.79,59

1,286,2485.655,2492.59,It's actually like the most obvious kind of love and it's right there and it happens all the time but were prevented from perceiving it because we're not really supposed to,0.84,59
1,287,2492.443,2500.89,talk about things like that it's like there's something unseemly about it well it's also in the west is this of individualist society so like,0.85,59
1,288,2500.86,2507.12,there's a pressure to sort of see the individual as a distinct Sovereign entity.,0.91,59
1,289,2507.855,2517.373,That experience is things is that the unity between people is not it's not obviously sort of communicated or talked about or is part of the culture.,0.85,60
1,290,2517.685,2528.086,"Yeah it's not part of the culture and yet you know you see it in our behaviors because we're humans so you know why do people listen to sad music I mean one reason is,",0.91,60
1,291,2528.155,2534.153,"they're hearing expressed for them like the musician is basically saying to them this thing that,",0.91,60
1,292,2534.186,2541.373,"you have experienced I've experienced it to still have lots of other people and but they're saying it all without words and it's,",0.85,60
1,293,2541.505,2550.186,transformed into something beautiful and there's something about that that's just incredibly elevating I people don't know it but.,0.86,60
1,294,2551.03,2555.57,Okay there's one study that I have in Bittersweet the found that,0.84,61
1,295,2555.531,2570.513,people whose favorite songs are there happy songs play it on their playlist about 175 times the people who love sad music play them about 800 times and they say that they feel connected to the sublime when,0.77,61
1,296,2570.474,2581.91,when they're listening to that music what do you think that is so what is that what what is it in music that connects us to the sublime through sadness.,0.89,61
1,297,2582.925,2587.807,I mean I have a bunch of different theories like the whole reason I started.,0.79,62
1,298,2588.155,2596.08,"Writing this book is because I kept having this reaction reliably to sad music and,",0.8300000000000001,62
1,299,2596.239,2607.369,I realized that for people who I knew who were religious Believers the way they describe their experience of God was what I was experiencing when I would hear that music.,0.86,62
1,300,2607.735,2621.664,"Like all the time it happens over and over again so you wonder what that is and yeah so I started wondering what that is and lots of people have tried to figure out you know what that's all about,",0.91,62
1,301,2621.724,2630.928,and there are different theories that it's expressing it's like a kind of catharsis for our difficult emotions that it's as we were saying expensive,0.88,62
1,302,2630.916,2637.247,"being in it together
we don't react in that sort of uplifted way,",0.91,62
1,303,2637.262,2646.439,"when you just see like a slideshow of sad faces which is something researchers have actually tested no one really cares when there seems like the sad faces,",0.89,62
1,304,2646.517,2659.078,but the sad music they're really reacting and also they don't really react when they're hearing music expressing other negative emotions like martial music or something like that it's just the sad music that gives people with elevated sense of wonder.,0.89,62
1,305,2659.399,2667.234,So I think it's the combination of the sadness and the beauty and I think it's just tapping into.,0.85,62
1,306,2668.014,2677.289,The essence of the human source code which is a kind of spiritual longing whether we're atheists are believers there's this feeling of longing for,0.91,63
1,307,2677.124,2693.079,a state and a place of perfect love and perfect unity and perfect truth and all of it and I like an acute awareness that we're not there in this world and you know in religions we express that through the longing for Mecca or Eden or Zion.,0.6900000000000001,63
1,308,2693.778,2696.059,And artistically express it with.,0.91,64

1,311,2713.097,2723.3,there's something about that state that's at our very core and I think that's why we love it so much well it could be you know you can have the Ernest Becker theory of denial of death where,0.91,64
1,312,2723.153,2735.192,at the core of that the warm of the core as young said is the fear of death so we're the longing for the perfect thing is has to do with,0.8200000000000001,64

1,348,3059.505,3066.277,can express something through their art that they might or might not express if you were just like hanging out with them and having a coffee.,0.86,73
1,349,3078.86,3086.793,Like a focus of remembering of like a deep focus of connection that's why when I interact with folks.,0.89,73
1,350,3087.151,3096.696,It's so draining for me because I'm putting all my whatever weapons I got in terms of like deeply.,0.88,73
1,351,3096.981,3109.947,Try to understand the person in front of me and doing that dance of human interaction the the humor the intense kind of delving into who they are so it which requires like me.,0.8200000000000001,73
1,352,3110.34,3114.61,Navigating around like small talk type of stuff and,0.91,74
1,353,3114.562,3121.308,and just like compliments and so on in general it could be people depending on the culture depending on the place they'll sometimes,0.91,74
1,354,3121.071,3129.581,flower stuff was smiling and like compliments like oh yeah I love you this is great but the like this that's all great but you want to get to the core of like,0.71,74
1,355,3129.434,3135.604,"what are the demons in the closet let's talk about it you know and that could be exhausting,",0.91,74
1,356,3135.637,3144.372,they can be really exhausting so from a letter code perspective you get more and more famous it can be hard sometimes because he probably also an introvert.,0.91,74
1,357,3144.585,3159.505,Yeah I know he was an introvert because he actually tweeted about my book when it came out so that was a precious moment for me something about we should all be listening to the quiet I can't remember exactly what he said but yeah yeah no he definitely was.,0.86,74
1,358,3159.754,3167.292,He struggled with depression which I wonder if that's something that's also connected to introversion,0.91,74
1,359,3167.262,3177.329,but perhaps not actually perhaps that they're very disjoint and and also connected to sensitivity and many sensitive people are introverts so it's kind of like a Venn diagram,0.81,74
1,360,3177.263,3184.342,about 80% of highly sensitive people are introverted but then some are extroverts and then not all introverts are sensitive,0.77,74
1,361,3184.276,3190.527,so it's complicated but he was definitely a sensitive type well there's on top of that you see like.,0.91,74
1,362,3190.992,3202.428,"The percent of artist relative to the average of suffer from depression so creative people oh yes very high very very crazy yeah and then the number of artists and successful artists who were orphaned,",0.78,75
1,363,3202.497,3210.494,"when they were young who lost one parent or both parents like an astronomical number I have it in the book and remember the percentage but huge,",0.87,75
1,364,3210.572,3216.336,and he was one of them he lost his father when he was 9 and his First Act of poetry was.,0.86,75
1,365,3217.198,3227.319,Was he took his father made suits that's why I thought of him when we were talking about you and and he took one of his father's bowties and wrote a poem.,0.88,76
1,366,3227.514,3234.611,In his honor and buried the poem and the bow tie in the back yard and that was like his first creative act.,0.78,76
1,367,3234.824,3242.497,You know that song Chelsea Hotel number to sure where he met I guess it's about Janis Joplin yeah.,0.77,76
1,368,3242.881,3246.908,"What a fun intense,",0.79,76
1,369,3246.959,3263.175,and cruel person she is so I guess have you ever seen I'm sorry to interrupt you but have you ever seen his son Adam cone and Lana Del Rey perform that song together oh no incredible I have to send it to you,0.89,76
1,370,3263.01,3265.902,"yeah so that for people who don't know I don't,",0.9,76
1,371,3265.99,3275.238,"I mean maybe I don't know it goes I remember you well on the Chelsea Hotel you're talking so brave and so sweet giving me head,",0.9,76
1,372,3275.397,3285.006,on the unmade bed while The Limousines weighed in the street that's a good line in there about about being ugly,0.81,76
1,373,3284.903,3297.186,yeah we are ugly but we have the music no before that from a guy's perspective it was oh you told me again you preferred handsome man but for me you would make an exception yeah,0.88,76
1,374,3297.039,3304.252,so good will she continue that thread in later because I think he said that he was lousy in bed.,0.74,76
1,375,3304.691,3312.318,I was that right yeah she publicly said that which is like man this they're just.,0.6900000000000001,77
1,376,3312.55,3323.985,Okay for people don't know I think this is a true story about them interacting and and being together for a very brief time I don't know dating but just connecting falling in love or.,0.85,77
1,377,3324.189,3337.03,In this only in this very particular way that I think famous musicians poets Can-Can which is like it's impossible for that kind of thing to last but they they did for brief.,0.8300000000000001,77
1,378,3337.666,3346.446,Moment is like a sadness to it because it's so momentarily but it's so epic yeah these,0.91,78
1,379,3346.2,3355.745,two paths Crossing you just look at the we know these famous people and it's really interesting to watch yeah you don't even have the impression that they're thinking it's going to last,0.77,78
1,380,3355.508,3365.396,they more know that it's like a blaze of an intersection yeah and the The Limousines already waiting while they're in the moment in the middle of it and then it's done,0.91,78
1,381,3365.339,3369.861,yeah and he talked about how his music.,0.84,78
1,382,3370.299,3383.094,He said he said something like some people are more inclined to say hello with her music but I'm rather more valedictory that's what he said what is Valedictorian saying goodbye like this valedictorians address.,0.91,78
1,383,3383.388,3384.4,Interesting.,0.91,78
1,384,3385.522,3398.326,You know it's so many of his songs really are about some form of parting or goodbye or an imperfection or something or like the Broken Hallelujah yeah that's the thing that's so.,0.76,79
1,385,3398.845,3400.586,Incredible about him.,0.81,79
1,386,3401.249,3410.083,"Is the
is the way that he's taking all of that and pointing it in the direction of transcendence like it's not.",0.91,79
1,387,3410.431,3418.302,It's not just pure sadness its sadness and beauty and that's the thing yeah there is a feeling of transcendence and a lot of the songs.,0.89,79
1,388,3418.848,3423.028,It's like sadness and Transcendence he writes a goodbye.,0.68,79
1,389,3424.34,3434.011,But you're moving on to some bigger thing but in a sort of ethereal way like not like a proud arrogant way.,0.91,80
1,390,3434.557,3443.661,Yeah so his favorite poet was a Garcia Lorca he actually named his daughter after him his daughter's name is Lorca and.,0.8200000000000001,80
1,391,3444.064,3452.439,"And he talked about how
there's some poem that Lorca had written that made him realize that.",0.8300000000000001,80
1,392,3452.832,3462.665,"The universe itself was aching but the ache was okay because that's the way you embrace the Sun and the Moon
I mean that's what I think is.",0.78,80
1,393,3463.617,3468.796,That's why I think there's this whole Rich vein in this.,0.88,81
1,394,3469.135,3478.833,"Bittersweet tradition that he embodies that's like the essence of beauty you know it's the way you embrace the Sun and the Moon
the song Hallelujah return to that often.",0.8300000000000001,81
1,395,3479.713,3487.241,Have been me to play it I've now friend who wants to sing it with me this thing ER.,0.86,82
1,396,3487.41,3496.072,Hmm what is when somebody says they're a singer do they have to be good,0.86,82
1,397,3495.979,3504.751,because then no but I would say yes I was in a band for a while I sang for a while I was always bad but I enjoy it.,0.8,82
1,398,3505.009,3513.186,I enjoy I enjoy lyrics I enjoy words yeah one sung or spoken they capture something they could get in that moment,0.8,82
1,399,3513.183,3517.768,Tom Waits is a huge favorite of mine for that reason,0.91,82
1,400,3517.729,3529.624,"although he often his lyrics are often not that not that simple I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy he's always playing with just like,",0.9,82
1,401,3529.72,3535.871,"these weird word play that's especially in the English language just,",0.8200000000000001,82
1,402,3535.968,3544.064,"trickier to do I'm fortunate enough to know another language which is Russian so I get to understand the certain languages allow for more world,",0.87,82
1,403,3544.07,3551.13,wordplay that others English for that reason I don't think has a like.,0.77,82
1,404,3551.902,3557.927,Like a like a culture of you know what I mean to push back on what I'm about to say but there was no.,0.8300000000000001,83
1,405,3558.212,3571.728,"Culture of word play until hip-hop came along hmm so like like distorting words in interesting ways for there to be a rhythm rhyme,",0.76,83
1,406,3571.815,3577.633,"and the same time you capturing some really powerful message plus humor,",0.86,83
1,407,3577.639,3590.398,all that makes that actually hip hop does it does a really good job of this but there wasn't a tradition if you look at poetry in the 20th century that wasn't really a tradition of that in the United States but there was in other parts of the world and certainly in Russia,0.75,83
1,408,3590.278,3598.563,interesting empowered also not just by Language by the fact that you go through a World War where tens of millions of people died something about Mass,0.8300000000000001,83
1,409,3598.398,3603.506,"Mass death of civilians that inspires great literature and music and art,",0.91,83
1,410,3603.62,3615.668,yeah absolutely because you start telling the real truth I think yes this is there's no more reason for small talk that's funny I always have thought that.,0.8300000000000001,83
1,411,3615.98,3620.079,If I could choose any other medium besides writing it would be singing,0.84,84
1,412,3619.95,3633.51,"but then the singer no I mean like I'm really not I just love the idea of it but then I also think you know fundamentally a shy person so I think it's much better that my medium is writing instead of singing so like it all worked out,",0.79,84
1,413,3633.651,3640.784,that said you also an exceptionally good public speaker and you're not supposed to be,0.8,84
1,414,3640.7,3654.422,mathematically speaking mathematically speaking you're not supposed to be a good public speaker Oh you mean because of shyness or yeah because the shine is because of introversion because of all those kinds of things oh yeah but lots of introverts are public speakers actually,0.86,84
1,415,3654.338,3660.049,like this is one of I knew this from the studies but then also when I started going out on the lecture circuit,0.81,84
1,416,3660.01,3668.097,I realized that all my fellow speakers at all these conferences I was going through there all introverts because you know they're all people who like spent years.,0.84,84
1,417,3668.265,3680.871,"Figuring out some idea and now they're out there talking about it though they're in their head figuring out the idea yeah how do you explain how do you explain that the the public speakers would you say the good public speakers are usually introverts,",0.8,84
1,418,3680.949,3685.12,"no I think there's just different styles of it and I think that we just have,",0.84,84
1,419,3685.234,3691.971,"when we hear the word public speaker we have a really limited idea of who that person would be,",0.91,84
1,420,3692.067,3701.405,for me I like I used to be very phobic about public speaking and part of the reason for it was because I thought that being the kind of person I was.,0.78,84
1,421,3702.311,3710.129,Didn't equal being able to be a good public speaker because you're only imagining you know like the super kind of out there Showman.,0.87,85
1,422,3710.36,3716.178,But I think there's another style of public speaking that's more reflective and,0.91,85
1,423,3716.148,3729.087,thoughtful and conveying ideas and people like that too is there advice you can give on how to overcome that like if you're a shy person to be a public speaker I can totally give that advice because,0.91,85
1,424,3729.084,3737.63,"I used to before I would give speeches you know if I had to do it in law school if I knew like today was the day when I was going to get called on in a law school class,",0.89,85
1,425,3737.664,3744.778,I literally went I'm vomited on my way to class like that bound her wrists I used to be and.,0.7000000000000001,85
1,426,3745.108,3753.907,Yeah the way to do it is through desensitization you know it's like been figured out it's the way to overcome any fear you have to expose yourself to the thing you fear.,0.8300000000000001,86
1,427,3754.156,3756.085,But in very small doses.,0.91,87
1,428,3756.271,3768.913,"So you can't start by giving the Ted Talk you have to start II started by going to this class for people with public speaking anxiety where the first day all we had to do is stand up and say our name,",0.87,87
1,429,3769.001,3771.83,and the down I like that's the victory.,0.8200000000000001,87
1,430,3772.052,3783.551,"That's fun to watch all those people exactly T just okay that's the first step in the step one step at a time yeah and then like with this class you go back the next week and,",0.8300000000000001,88
1,431,3783.692,3790.762,and he would have us come to the front of the room and stand up with other people standing next to us yeah so that,0.87,88
1,432,3790.624,3800.151,you didn't have the feeling of being all alone in the spotlight through others sharing it with you and you would answer some questions about where'd you grow up you know where do you go to school,0.89,88
1,433,3800.094,3808.847,and you declare Victory and you're done and then little by little by little you keep ratcheting up the exercises until you get to the point where you can do it,0.91,88
1,434,3808.782,3813.457,and then you start having successes and you realize oh you know actually I can do this,0.88,88
1,435,3813.454,3819.092,what about like writing versus improvising because I knew a few people,0.79,88
1,436,3819.026,3824.133,the colleagues of mine that were working on TED talks and feels like.,0.8300000000000001,88
1,437,3824.346,3832.505,You're supposed to like right the thing like way ahead of time and you practice it and they can help you and all that kind of stuff I don't think I've ever,0.79,88
1,438,3832.34,3840.364,"practice the speech once in my life or a lecture or any of that like I know it's really good to do but is what do you find,",0.85,88
1,439,3840.461,3849.277,that release some of the anxiety preparing well or are you not able to do not preparing well at all I definitely like to prepare.,0.91,88
1,440,3850.165,3864.175,Before but the kind of preparation that I've done for my TED Talks is completely different from what I've done for everything else because TED Talks are more like a theatrical event where it's like a one-person show and of course if you were,0.8300000000000001,89
1,441,3864.163,3868.982,I'm going to go and Broadway with a monologue you would know every word so it's kind of like that,0.8,89
1,442,3868.952,3878.462,and so I would rehearse it over and over the way you do that isn't that more anxiety knowing every single word it's so much anxiety because yeah your,0.86,89
1,443,3878.36,3888.067,"you're not even so freaked out about being on stage so much as what if I forget something yeah yeah absolutely I mean if they do things like the last Ted Talk I gave,",0.8200000000000001,89
1,444,3888.11,3897.565,I actually did forget something halfway through like I just couldn't remember the next line and so I had to walk over like over there where my notes yeah and.,0.67,89
1,445,3898.156,3911.356,So I did that and the audience like very kindly clapped well I did that and then I came back to the spotlight and kept going and they edit that out no your dad there's a failure modes it's okay it seems really,0.8,89
1,446,3911.209,3916.631,it seems really stressful like I'm now I'm not sure if I'll ever publish it but.,0.78,89
1,447,3917.448,3923.563,I've been most is for personal Journey but I've been working on.,0.79,90
1,448,3923.956,3941.676,A series on wait for it Hitler in the Third Reich so of looking at the historical context of everything because of my family was so much affected by that whole part of History so for me to rigorously I've read a lot about Stalin and Hitler and for me too,0.91,90
1,449,3941.502,3947.248,"Force must one of the best ways to force yourself to really consider material it's a have to,",0.8200000000000001,90
1,450,3947.254,3953.82,talk about it totally yeah so that's why I'm doing it but I'm playing with ideas of.,0.8300000000000001,90
1,451,3954.105,3959.347,Some of it may be like twenty percent is written down on paper.,0.7000000000000001,90
1,452,3959.615,3965.478,But the rest of it is my thoughts in the moment that's a difficult balance.,0.88,90
1,453,3965.7,3971.158,The strike is the if you write a lot you're going to be more precise you going to be more accurate.,0.79,90
1,454,3971.407,3978.198,But you're going to miss some of the deep like honest emotion the silence is won't be.,0.7000000000000001,90
1,455,3978.483,3984.869,Correct or the silences between the words won't capture.,0.9,90
1,456,3985.937,3994.564,The depth of feeling unless if you're somebody like me if you're like I Guess That's What actors and actresses have to do like.,0.85,91
1,457,3995.2,4009.445,"Basically even though the script is fully written you improvise between the word between the lines yeah that's a skill well it also takes so much time I mean I experienced that with the TED Talks it's like,",0.91,91
1,458,4009.586,4015.747,you get your stage so you're memorizing everything word-for-word and at first in that process,0.8300000000000001,91
1,459,4015.626,4027.026,it comes out in a really wooden way the way you're saying like the emotions gone but once you really know it so you've internalized the words then all the emotion comes back and you can stay them in a completely different way,0.89,91
1,460,4026.906,4036.65,you know when you're really speaking it from the heart but you have to know it so well before you can do that most of I would never recommend it because it's just like it's so time-consuming,0.71,91
1,461,4036.584,4046.939,it's an inch well it in your case it works out beautiful like when it when it all comes together it is a theatrical thing it's like a musical or whatever.,0.78,91
1,462,4047.18,4055.996,I'm going to think I'm going to come out with a one-man show on Broadway singing now I'm inspired for Real where are you going,0.8200000000000001,91
1,463,4055.939,4062.261,where are you going to talk about Hitler and Stalin and everything you're learning to have you ever thought of.,0.8,91
1,464,4062.573,4068.041,Using the medium of just speaking into a microphone but without the video.,0.91,91
1,465,4068.974,4077.088,I'm curious about this because like I fell in love with podcasts originally before there was ever this whole video component to it,0.91,92
1,466,4077.004,4083.237,and I realized there's something so Primal and magical about having someone's voice in your ear,0.87,92
1,467,4083.09,4089.601,my favorite kinds of interviews still very few people do it this way nowadays but my favorite kind Darwin.,0.81,92
1,468,4089.949,4093.427,You're just talking into the microphone so it's not over Zoom.,0.88,92
1,469,4093.973,4101.322,It's not in person it's just you in the microphone and the other person in the microphone and they're in your ear it's like the ultimate in intimacy.,0.72,92
1,470,4101.58,4110.54,Oh you mean from the interviewer perspective this yeah ever yeah but I but it would be interesting also is with the kind of thing you're talking about of just speaking,0.71,92
1,471,4110.466,4119.75,"like just you in the mic I would love to be in person but you can't see the person I wonder what that's like good family mean like they're all there but behind a curtain ourselves your eyes closed,",0.84,92
1,472,4119.882,4132.353,talking you have your eyes closed or whatever you have because I think you still have get the same kind of chemistry because it's not just the visual that I don't even know that because obviously I have trouble making I got that,0.66,92
1,473,4132.242,4140.014,"but as I don't know if the visual stimulation is the necessary thing there's something about the way audio travels that captures the intimacy,",0.78,92
1,474,4140.038,4145.721,were some people actually have headphones on like Joe does this have headphones on that's really intimate.,0.87,92
1,475,4146.06,4154.327,Like there's something about that sound going directly into your ear yeah yeah there is something Primal there yeah for sure I've.,0.91,92
1,476,4154.936,4161.025,I've thought about it definitely is some of my favorite podcasts are like that WTF with Marc Maron,0.81,93
1,477,4160.869,4169.946,"that's Audio Only this does a few Audio Only podcast that I just love and what is that I've I still go on clubhouse that that was a,",0.85,93
1,478,4170.042,4175.006,"let's social media platform rates Audio Only and so interesting that people,",0.6900000000000001,93
1,479,4175.084,4181.1,the interesting thing about Clubhouse in particular people from all walks of life can tune in and they just,0.84,93
1,480,4180.917,4190.238,yeah I have it's a somebody needs to do some research in terms of introversion on that one because I don't feel any of my introvert,0.91,93
1,481,4190.154,4191.201,um,0.53,93
1,482,4191.612,4201.337,"Like triggers happening because nobody can see is just audio and nobody is offended if you're just sitting there,",0.89,93
1,483,4201.425,4206.873,quietly just listening so you can you can participate whenever you want or not,0.91,93
1,484,4206.807,4219.99,yeah it's like the ultimate social Freedom yeah you can listen as much as you'd like you can participate if you want but you don't have to it's no big deal yeah nobody can like if I'm actually a physical party somebody's going to look at me right if you like why,0.91,93
1,485,4219.969,4228.155,"you know they'll be that pressure to speak but you don't have to in that kind of audio setting and there's that intimacy like you can,",0.85,93
1,486,4228.287,4233.115,when it's Audio Only feels like you can reveal a lot more of yourself in some kind of.,0.86,93
1,487,4233.743,4246.411,"Honest way I don't know what that is what is that a but I was I don't know but I assume it's tapping into something really ancient like we used to tell stories around the fire like our whole storytelling tradition was oral,",0.87,94
1,488,4246.48,4251.597,originally maybe that but we used visual stuff like,0.8200000000000001,94
1,489,4251.549,4260.293,"that's so you can actually see the person I seems like he seems like the visual elements so fundamental to the social interaction but there is,",0.77,94
1,490,4260.38,4272.221,something Primal about audio I wonder what that is in still that's why I mean most people listen to podcast I think Audio Only they have it in their ears while they're doing stuff yeah that's how I do it,0.88,94
1,491,4272.083,4275.642,and then there's that's how I judge and that's what that's where the friendship.,0.8300000000000001,94
1,492,4276.386,4283.339,Like is formed it's weird that deep connection with other humans is formed because they're in your ear.,0.81,95
1,493,4283.669,4295.717,And you get to see them grow you get to see them be bored experience excitement and anger and fear and all those kinds of things it's fascinating it's fascinating.,0.8200000000000001,95
1,494,4295.903,4301.578,The world of podcasting is fascinating because we're we're in this world of essentially radio.,0.78,95
1,495,4302.367,4312.182,"Even though we all have all this high-definition content all this like Tick-Tock style fast stuff and still I know and we still choose to do this,",0.84,96
1,496,4312.332,4316.197,so we're at the end of the day I think that's really what people want most is.,0.71,96
1,497,4316.374,4324.849,To talk to each other and to know what people really think and podcasting of all the media that I've ever seen is the one where people come closest to telling you the truth.,0.9,96
1,498,4328.734,4340.197,"The good and the bad and the bitter and the sweet and all of it but she long-form there's not enough time yeah exactly I had to explain this to people like you talk to CEOs and stuff they don't understand,",0.84,96
1,499,4340.293,4344.987,they understand they're starting to understand much better now I as a hard requirement.,0.75,96
1,500,4345.524,4354.709,With axios and stuff is that has to be three hours I say like this WOW because there's something they can't,0.77,96
1,501,4354.508,4368.833,beam doing marketing stuff for three hours the break I start being human to start relaxing and if they can't that also tells the kind of story but I do that kind of torture for CEOs only anyway yeah when I was there.,0.78,96
1,502,4369.163,4375.522,Getting my Publishing House did media training with me before a Bittersweet came out and.,0.91,96
1,503,4375.997,4387.945,And they were preparing me for like the five to seven-minute interview that you might have you know if you go on some quick TV thing or something like that and God I hate that it's like it feels like there.,0.8300000000000001,96
1,504,4388.842,4403.834,You're basically having to not tell the full truth somehow because you can't you can't tell it in such a short amount of time well the other thing it's me podcasting was just the best thing that's ever happened the other downside of the 7 Minute interview.,0.88,97
1,505,4404.128,4408.74,Is I think you could do a really good job with that but the the dance partner has to be very good,0.76,97
1,506,4408.72,4421.299,it's actually challenging for everybody involved it's much harder for everybody involved hmm because you if you can do you know I can imagine like a Christopher Hitchens type character who's just super witty.,0.72,97
1,507,4422.088,4434.316,Did then that you could do a seven-minute thing you can get to the core a Bittersweet you can get to the core of the book without asking those generic Small Talk questions because too many people in that short form interview.,0.9,98
1,508,4434.853,4448.09,I just asking very generic questions they're doing small talk for so yes yes I all right you only get seven minutes you only get one interesting question go ask the weirdest the the deepest question that.,0.78,98
1,509,4449.176,4460.009,"That also energizes the other person it's an art form that people don't take seriously I think the 7-minute thing five minute or even less,",0.86,98
1,510,4460.024,4462.232,and then the commercials which I,0.91,98
1,511,4462.067,4480.777,yeah and I've noticed that many of these roulette with best podcasters or ones where when you're on my side of the table you feel like it's more of a conversation and less like an interview or you're answering all the same questions you've asked you've answered a million times before it's really interesting how different,0.88,98
1,512,4480.62,4485.061,experiences and you're right though I do audio thing.,0.74,98
1,513,4485.716,4496.512,"If you can lose yourself in that the intimacy of that and you don't even remember what stupid stuff you said it's people I've seen that I mean people don't give them enough credit as,",0.85,98
1,514,4496.555,4506.262,even in you might not be aware might not be a fan but Joe Rogan is a incredible conversationalist and that he makes you forget.,0.76,98
1,515,4507.141,4517.983,That anything is being recorded the year talking at all makes you forget time and you just enjoy yourself and that's whatever that is.,0.78,99
1,516,4519.096,4530.145,"And that plugs then you plug into that Primal connection to other humans
what's your favorite Leonard Cohen song famous blue raincoat do you know that one,",0.86,100
1,517,4530.313,4538.436,maybe I'll play it yeah for people who don't know what word Cohen and this is your first introduction to him it's going to sound so gloomy.,0.78,100
1,518,4539.019,4543.91,"It's so good he's got this deep rich voice,",0.91,100
1,519,4544.06,4558.844,Tori Amos covering famous blue raincoat yeah no we want what the original just like Hallelujah Jeff Buckley covered Leonard Cohen that was a really good one that was a really good one yeah and I also really like Rufus Wainwright it's cover,0.91,100
1,520,4558.734,4567.261,but famous blue raincoat for people who don't know it it's basically about a love triangle and it's told from the perspective.,0.91,100

1,542,4748.816,4758.65,And I got there and at the beginning I was feeling like this was all a terrible mistake because it's all these other musicians,0.89,109
1,543,4758.574,4765.374,playing this music and I don't actually really want to hear them like I'd rather listen to him on YouTube yeah and then.,0.91,109

1,555,4861.164,4875.112,The original some hi you're just making it your own you making your own right it's not but not overlapping it really nothing partying from this the spirit of the original it's tough because the original Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen.,0.78,113
1,556,4876.288,4884.132,It's just not it's it's so powerful but it's just not as good as some of these covers well I think.,0.91,114
1,557,4884.561,4894.53,"I think it's the words in the melody and then the covers take it to a different place the thing that Leonard Cohen seems to do well he I don't think he did it on,",0.86,114
1,558,4894.644,4901.336,"Hallelujah because he was almost being playful on all of it like I don't know,",0.8300000000000001,114
1,559,4901.377,4913.092,as opposed to that deep Melancholy like painful longing thing that Jeff Buckley did and others do too I wonder if it's because in a way he.,0.81,114
1,560,4913.476,4924.607,Hey that he over edited it but he apparently worked on that song for years and well if you gazillions of versus and checked most of them out so I wonder if we're hearing his version after.,0.8,115
1,561,4924.864,4929.971,He's like a little tired with that process yeah well that's the thing is like,0.9,115
1,562,4929.879,4941.288,"maybe for my book tour you know is like you get tired of saying the same thing over and over and over and over you forget if you get the I forgot like the initial look the heart of it,",0.88,115

1,566,4962.296,4966.935,it is so surreal to be hanging out with them and he's such a daughter such a like,0.76,115
1,567,4966.923,4980.016,very few people I met in my life are just as good of a human being and that has to do with the fact that he's struggling struggles he still I think struggles but he struggled for a long time with depression and so out of that pain,0.87,115
1,568,4980.012,4988.037,you see born this is really good human being this really good relationship with his wife like that.,0.91,115
1,569,4989.096,4998.884,When times are good they Lea and each other for like they did their deeply grateful for those precious moments so it's beautiful to watch but the he said that.,0.8200000000000001,116
1,570,4999.971,5005.041,It's really important to feel the song every time.,0.89,117
1,571,5005.678,5011.316,"Otherwise people know people are really good at detecting your bullshit you can't fake it,",0.91,117
1,572,5011.413,5022.605,yeah you really have to feel it every time you have to feel the emotion of It Whatever the emotion is of the original time you wrote it yeah it's just interesting because it.,0.86,117
1,573,5023.079,5025.036,I thought you could maybe fake it.,0.8200000000000001,117
1,574,5026.005,5037.684,But he says he believes person is because he played in front of the gigantic crowds and over and over and over and over and over it's like no every time you have to have to be there there's got to be times when he's about to go out,0.73,118
1,575,5037.51,5045.12,"and he's not feeling it and he has to figure out some way of getting himself into that her space that's what he's saying you have to otherwise you're just,",0.91,118
1,576,5045.135,5050.116,that's the job right don't take the job then.,0.91,118
1,577,5050.446,5057.12,And he loves it he says the biggest struggle in fact is the come down from that which is like.,0.86,118
1,578,5057.738,5070.056,You have this such a beautiful experience of connected with this large number of people sharing a song that you love and then it's such a rush of connection and then you have to.,0.77,119
1,579,5070.503,5087.71,You know when you get off stage you're now back to normal life and that's why a lot of musicians get into heavy drugs and all that kind of stuff because you're looking for that Rush again this very tough to the then go into this speaking of introvert because he probably is an introvert as,0.87,119
1,580,5087.544,5088.474,"is like,",0.91,119
1,581,5088.625,5098.44,you have to find that calmness and how do you find the calmness when you were just playing in front of tens of thousands of people a hundred thousand whatever that number is,0.8300000000000001,119
1,582,5098.266,5101.492,that Rush of connect and everybody is love in the air,0.76,119
1,583,5101.381,5111.772,and you still have to find that like inner peace and calm that's interesting because I so I don't know if this is the introvert in me talking and the writer in me talking but.,0.8300000000000001,119
1,584,5112.066,5120.829,I don't know like I love most the moments where let's say I'll get a letter from a reader who will tell me what something I wrote meant to them.,0.81,119
1,585,5121.015,5131.964,And they'll talk about having had that kind of moment of you know the communion between the writer and the reader and obviously I wasn't there physically when it happened so I wasn't getting that kind of Rush that a musician would get in a concert.,0.91,119
1,586,5133.177,5139.167,Just the knowledge of that having happened out there in the world due to something that I added to it.,0.8,120
1,587,5139.452,5149.249,"Yeah it's the most amazing love it but see imagine yeah imagine reading like thousands of those letters and then it's such a strong rush and everything else doesn't,",0.77,120
1,588,5149.291,5159.179,it could be overwhelming I guess this is but like anything else you have to come down and find a calm place like for example the danger.,0.85,120
1,589,5159.986,5166.992,"People getting letters like that you start taking yourself too seriously you think like you are a special person somehow but,",0.79,121
1,590,5166.998,5177.948,"that's you really want to avoid that feeling too yeah I don't actually experience it as that much different from when I'm on the other side of it like if I'm the reader and,",0.79,121
1,591,5178.062,5189.102,some other writer has made me feel that way to me it's the same thing yeah me too yeah it's a it's a cool it's a virtual hug I think it's like I was just listening to something about.,0.89,121
1,592,5189.513,5192.37,The different Russian writers.,0.8300000000000001,121
1,593,5192.655,5201.651,I was mentioning him to you this academic his name is Gary saw Morrison and he studies Russian literature and he was talking about.,0.81,121
1,594,5201.9,5209.654,Don't know if I'll be able to get this right but basically that the people misunderstand a work like Anna Karenina and that we think of it as.,0.84,121
1,595,5210.146,5215.83,Telling us that you're supposed to live you're supposed to have like.,0.91,122
1,596,5216.169,5229.306,Grand tempestuous romances that might end in death or just bear whatever it is but you know you should be in it for the intensity of the emotion and he's saying actually that's not.,0.8300000000000001,122
1,597,5229.484,5234.186,But exactly not what Tolstoy was saying that,0.8,122
1,598,5234.065,5247.887,actually it was the opposite that he was really making he was really advocating for everyday life he was saying it scenes from everyday like he was juxtaposing Anna Karenina with all these other couples who were just living happily and quietly day by day.,0.91,122
1,599,5248.37,5256.511,"And that was what he believed was the ideal so as opposed to the ground rush and as opposed to the,",0.89,122
1,600,5256.643,5263.884,intensity owner if he is there a depth to the is there a romance that just the day-to-day,0.74,122
1,601,5263.674,5277.009,this is the romance to the day-to-day and don't get lately don't get distracted by the dopamine roller coaster ride of the grant romantic Notions yeah and it enjoy it while it's happening because those are life experiences also but,0.79,122
1,602,5276.997,5280.817,not to mistake those for being everything where is he from.,0.8200000000000001,122
1,603,5281.003,5288.001,He's a professor at Northwestern and Northwestern and apparently his lectures are like the most popular on campus well.,0.88,122
1,604,5288.547,5300.64,People love them Gary saw Morrison is an American literary critic a slob pissed he's particularly known for scholarly work on the great Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy and fyodor Dostoevsky,0.8,123
1,605,5300.385,5304.403,Morrison is Lawrence T professor in arts and humanities at Northwestern University.,0.67,123
1,606,5304.688,5318.879,Wow and there's a lot of incredible work and then I'm sure looking through the lens of Russian literature and the romance of all of that he's looking at modern at the modern world yeah I think you should have him on your podcast and quiet flows the vodka or when Pushkin.,0.88,123
1,607,5319.155,5320.436,"Comes to shove,",0.91,123
1,608,5320.595,5330.609,the curmudgeons guide to Russian literature and culture this is a quote one of the silly books he has on the list okay cool what are you saying I'm sorry oh no I was just saying yeah.,0.89,123
1,609,5331.398,5333.157,I find that when I take,0.85,124
1,610,5333.118,5346.75,photos on my phone I hardly ever take photos at the moment you're supposed to like everybody's gathered for some event I'll forget to take the photo but I take a lot of like scenes from everyday life because that's what I actually want to remember in the end.,0.77,124
1,611,5347.071,5352.934,Yeah yeah I'm the same the same it's actually concerning.,0.89,124
1,612,5353.319,5368.157,Because it's bad for productivity because I love everyday life so much then why why do any ambitious big thing your productivity is pretty good I don't know that you have to worry about it and I do so I want to launch a business.,0.91,124
1,613,5368.497,5373.072,You know I have a dream outside this is like a fun side thing.,0.91,124
1,614,5373.267,5383.074,You know I want to there's been a lifelong passion anyway that's a like building I like building stuff and I haven't been doing that as much as I would like that's.,0.79,124
1,615,5383.359,5396.73,Because largely because I like sitting in silence and enjoying the beauty that is just nature and life and when there's people there's people I love people I love everything and so when you love everything.,0.86,124
1,616,5396.899,5399.494,Why go through hell to build a company.,0.89,124
1,617,5400.788,5411.899,"Yeah it's a valid question I mean I think you have to really good reason for wanting to do it but then your heart calls you for the certain sometimes you look out into the mountains and you say,",0.91,125
1,618,5411.905,5422.702,for some reason I long to go there even if it means leaving the tribe and putting yourself in danger and doing stupid shit that's the human imperative for exploration,0.79,125
1,619,5422.645,5425.898,yeah absolutely like when we were talking about.,0.91,125
1,620,5426.12,5433.028,You know this idea of longing being like the source code of humanity I think that's also the source code of our creativity.,0.91,125
1,621,5433.412,5438.852,"It's the same longing for Eden it's like you're always reaching for something,",0.87,125
1,622,5439.011,5446.342,that you want to get to or that you want to build yeah it's the best of us what do you think.,0.91,125
1,623,5446.96,5449.466,You read about creativity and sadness.,0.77,125
1,624,5449.913,5458.756,You practically speaking how should we leverage sadness for creativity this is that,0.91,125
1,625,5458.726,5464.986,sort of in the artist domain in the writer's domain in the engineering domains and so on it's,0.76,125
1,626,5464.938,5474.906,definitely in those domains but it's in all domains you know we're all going to face pain in this life at some point and we all have the ability to.,0.91,125
1,627,5476.109,5478.804,Whether it was dance with standard and.,0.78,126
1,628,5479.206,5488.472,Live with it for a bit and then try to transform it into something that we find beautiful you know and it's very easy to.,0.89,126
1,629,5490.297,5502.948,Didn't notice the Grandeur of like the you know the painting hanging on the gallery wall or the new company that's just been created but it takes a thousand different forms right you know you could bake a cake or like.,0.81,127
1,630,5503.494,5516.677,In the wake of the pandemic we've had more people applying to medical school and nursing school and after 9/11 you had people applying for jobs as firefighters and teachers so there's something in the human spirit that.,0.87,127
1,631,5516.998,5523.293,Takes pain and turns it into meaning when we're at our best and when we're not at our best we.,0.87,127
1,632,5523.498,5529.37,Deny the pain and then take it out on ourselves and on other people so there's a kind of fork in the road what to do with it.,0.91,127
1,633,5529.871,5537.688,But we know I mean there's all these studies that I go through in the book like there is one where.,0.88,127
1,634,5537.973,5550.669,The researchers had people watch different movies like happy movies sad movies Bittersweet movies and they found when people watch Father of the Bride just like the ultimate Bittersweet you know you're walking,0.81,127
1,635,5550.657,5554.513,your daughter down the aisle kind of feeling that was.,0.91,127
1,636,5554.897,5562.453,"They would give them creativity tasks after watching these different movies and the people who had been primed for bittersweetness were the most creative,",0.87,128
1,637,5562.612,5572.266,they were like primed to remember finality you know like love and finality basically love and impermanence there's something about that that's.,0.91,128
1,638,5572.587,5575.219,That gets us to our most beautiful state,0.89,129
1,639,5575.198,5585.589,I wonder if it is I mean there's studies like that there's a if you looked into the terror management Theory yeah that's really interesting stuff so they especially intensely,0.8,129
1,640,5585.496,5594.474,have you focused on that just sad but traumatic like death Prime you would death and see how that changes your mind,0.78,129
1,641,5594.426,5596.733,"the Hut like both like,",0.65,129
1,642,5596.794,5604.827,I don't I don't know if this creativity studies but they have interesting I think a little bit tainted by,0.87,129
1,643,5604.815,5613.1,political bias but maybe not mean psychology is a complicated field but they study like Cory likely to vote for right,0.85,129
1,644,5612.917,5628.368,"if you're primed by existential like by thinking about the fear of mortality feel mortality I forget what the conclusions are but I think they find that people become more tribalistic yeah you know like there is one study where they found that after they primed people that way that,",0.84,129
1,645,5628.41,5633.301,that they would get then give them the chance to put.,0.91,129
1,646,5633.505,5648.334,Hot sauce and meal that their political opponents were going to be eating and they put way too much hot sauce after they've been primed to worry about death I think at the core we're simple creatures so I actually like,0.85,130
1,647,5648.16,5657.463,in the book I spent a bunch of time with people who are working on radical life extension you know the quest to live forever,0.91,130
1,648,5657.361,5667.941,"and people ask them a lot questions like you know the kinds of questions you were talking about earlier well like how are you going to feed everybody and how is there going to be space for everybody if everyone really could live forever,",0.8,130
1,649,5668.011,5674.739,and what about conflict when we haven't intensified conflict and their answer to that is.,0.91,130
1,650,5675.311,5678.42,They point to Terror management Theory you know and they say.,0.91,131
1,651,5678.633,5692.121,"Because it's the fear of death they're basically saying it's the fear of death that are causing our conflicts in the first place and that if we remove the fear of death we'd have less conflict to contend with and that I don't really buy that,",0.9,131
1,652,5692.245,5705.571,it's possible that that's true but are you also how does the expression go throwing out the baby with the bathwater I are you also going to remove basically any source of meaning and,0.91,131
1,653,5705.514,5707.939,happiness in The Human Condition.,0.9,131
1,654,5708.269,5722.441,"It's very possible that death is fundamental to The Human Condition the fun finality yeah that's the great philosophical question and I went to a conference of people who are working on this and I thought,",0.8300000000000001,131
1,655,5722.547,5728.734,that they were going to be talking about those questions all through the conference but the mo is much more like.,0.87,131
1,656,5728.929,5738.24,"We're so happy that we're here with people who have gotten past all those quibbles yeah you know we just know there's going to be meeting no matter what the basic assumption is,",0.88,131
1,657,5738.355,5749.917,let's try to extend life indefinitely and then we'll figure out if that's a good decision or more like we're sure it's a good decision or earlier at least makes that was what I felt,0.84,131
1,658,5749.779,5753.94,it's it's it's either with that they sure it's either we're sure.,0.7000000000000001,131
1,659,5754.486,5763.69,It's a good decision or we're sure that is good to believe that it's a good decision meaning like there's no downside to,0.85,132
1,660,5763.588,5772.836,to that even if we find out it's wrong but yes there's a kind of certainty obviously you want to extend human life that's the kind of assumption that always seemed.,0.89,132
1,661,5773.103,5777.211,Now it could be true.,0.91,132
1,662,5777.667,5785.061,But just like the people who over focus on colonizing other planets.,0.85,132
1,663,5786.003,5788.797,It feels like you neglect the beauty.,0.91,133
1,664,5789.073,5801.742,And the the struggle of our life here on Earth I've sort of the same kind of criticism whether it's thinking about Valhalla or any other afterlife is you have if you're not careful.,0.88,133
1,665,5802.649,5806.801,Forget to make this life a great one,0.91,134
1,666,5806.735,5818.693,whatever happens afterwards so yeah definitely but from the engineering from a biology from a chemistry perspective is very interesting to think how do we extend this thing because it does seem that nature,0.76,134
1,667,5818.681,5821.61,the way designed living organisms.,0.91,134
1,668,5821.949,5831.603,It really wants us to die because that's part of the selection mechanism that's part of this seems to be fundamental to Evolution it.,0.9,134
1,669,5832.518,5833.206,"The kiss,",0.55,135
1,670,5833.355,5845.35,people young then use protection was the one third young brain they get to explore a lot of get to figure out the world that come up their own novel ideas how to adapt a how to respond to that world,0.79,135
1,671,5845.301,5855.369,and then as you get older and older they get like stubborn and stuck in their ways and so we need them to die so we make room for new,0.75,135
1,672,5855.321,5860.275,life that's able to adapt to the changing environment if the old doesn't die.,0.85,135
1,673,5860.668,5866.9,"Then you're not going to get stale and not be adaptable to the changing environment,",0.91,135
1,674,5866.916,5881.34,maybe it doesn't have to happen soon yeah maybe he doesn't think pressing listen I'm a big fan of pressing snooze and the alarm clock and the same way I do I'm one of the people that believe it's.,0.84,135
1,675,5882.364,5889.874,Or I don't definitely believe course I don't know but I think death is a.,0.89,136
1,676,5891.591,5901.352,"Is a fundamental part of life but yeah if I'm on my deathbed I would sure as hell Press News as many times as possible yeah I know this interesting because I,",0.85,137
1,677,5901.431,5911.156,"in some ways I really I share your instinct there is one scientist who I spoke to it that conference he's one of the leading Advocates and he said,",0.91,137
1,678,5911.315,5920.095,you know that's a story that we've invented for ourselves because we have no choice and if you really believe that you have no choice then your.,0.9,137
1,679,5920.318,5928.756,"Then it's adaptive to tell that story that death gives meaning to life good point but if you really think you don't if you really think you could triumph over it,",0.91,137
1,680,5928.77,5930.736,"would you still be telling that same story,",0.91,137
1,681,5930.85,5942.376,"and I've been thinking about that question ever since
yeah ya know they got a good point they got a good point no matter what as an engineering and the scientific Pursuits it's a beautiful one",0.79,137
1,682,5942.211,5951.18,in your personal life if we can go there sure what's up been some Dark Places you've got in your own mind,0.81,137
1,683,5951.123,5958.724,"grief loss
sad moments moments of sadness.",0.91,137
1,684,5959.198,5961.622,That have made you a better writer.,0.91,137
1,685,5962.538,5972.371,"Better Creator a better human being well
I mean I've been through a lot of bereavement just in these last couple of years with covid but.",0.84,138
1,686,5973.215,5975.441,Even before that.,0.91,139
1,687,5975.961,5989.998,I mean there's there's all kinds of stuff I write about in the book and in some ways I feel like I can write about things those kinds of things better than I can speak them but I had a really complicated relationship with my mother growing up where.,0.8,139
1,688,5990.886,6001.017,We had a kind of Garden of Eden during my childhood like we were intensely intensely close and and my mother because of.,0.79,140
1,689,6002.931,6008.164,Some vulnerabilities that she had reacted.,0.79,141
1,690,6008.35,6022.712,With a lot of trouble to my adolescence and to Growing independent from her and starting to have different religious views and different political views and all kinds of things and.,0.91,141
1,691,6024.248,6034.091,And we had a pretty intense break that I described in the book and and it was so intense that even though after that we.,0.78,142
1,692,6034.322,6049.043,Still would get together for holidays and talk to each other on the phone and all that there was a sense in which like it was over at that point the relationship was Over the Garden of Eden was no more yeah yeah it was like a feeling of like.,0.91,142
1,693,6049.527,6056.29,Yeah like I know what Eden was like and and it's not there anymore.,0.85,142
1,694,6056.458,6061.26,And I think it was all the more confusing because like if you lose someone to actual bereavement.,0.85,142
1,695,6061.572,6069.1,"You go through a mourning process and people have thought for thousands of years about how to do that but with something like this,",0.91,142
1,696,6069.152,6077.887,there's no process because you're not even admitting to yourself especially when you're like in your teens and 20s that your morning something so.,0.9,142
1,697,6078.433,6084.387,But but it was the case that for decades for decades I could not,0.74,143
1,698,6084.284,6098.862,answer even the simplest question about my mother like where did she grow up without tears in my eyes or more than tears in my eyes like embarrassing embarrassing tears so I would just try to steer the subject in another place,0.9,143
1,699,6098.724,6103.741,but I will say you know two things happened when is that I've spent,0.88,143
1,700,6103.685,6111.042,the last 67 years writing this book about joy and sorrow and loss and love and all of it.,0.85,143
1,701,6111.373,6119.774,And I've really come to terms with all of it and then the second thing that happened is my mother now has Alzheimer's and.,0.8,143
1,702,6120.753,6122.763,In her Alzheimer's.,0.91,144
1,703,6123.048,6133.143,She still actually the same person like she's forgotten most things but she still has these conversational lanes that you can travel down that are like the way she always was and.,0.91,144
1,704,6133.905,6145.206,The way that she was when I was a kid which was like so incredibly loving and so connected and so warm and sweet and funny and all of it all the things I remembered.,0.85,145
1,705,6145.617,6150.77,Like it's all come back and for all these decades.,0.91,145
1,706,6151.775,6165.128,I had been wondering whether that Garden of Eden I remembered had actually happened or whether you know that was just like the fantasy of a child and you know maybe it was always difficult and I had not seen it but.,0.8200000000000001,146
1,707,6165.773,6175.778,I'm seeing her now and I realized that it was all true everything I remember it was all true it all happened because it's happening again.,0.91,146
1,708,6176.044,6185.878,And you return to the Garden of Eden for time yeah and to Childhood it's always a question of whether you can return to that place.,0.76,146
1,709,6186.28,6191.18,"Well I don't know I don't even know if I'd say I've returned because I'm a different person now and I don't,",0.76,146
1,710,6191.294,6196.978,are you need her and you sure are you sure you're still a different than the,0.64,146
1,711,6196.867,6207.123,the then the ten-year-old well okay feel different no I mean I'm the same person in terms of my need for love and love of love and all of that but,0.91,146
1,712,6207.03,6208.501,I don't look.,0.81,146
1,713,6209.884,6222.823,I'm not dependent on my mother for it the way I was then and that makes the experience really different yeah they're younger she's a she's a god figure what is that that the roots the parents.,0.86,147
1,714,6223.19,6228.819,Such a funny civilization will live and there's a depth of connection to parents that's.,0.91,147
1,715,6229.293,6237.056,That's probably more powerful than anything else in terms of its formative effect on who you are I think it's the most powerful and in fact.,0.74,147
1,716,6238.269,6249.497,When this started happening I got to college and I took a class in creative writing and I tried to write a story a fictional story a fictionalized version of what was happening and I called it the most passionate love.,0.87,148
1,717,6250.115,6265.107,Because of what you just said yeah and the teacher actually said to me she's like you should put this story in a drawer and not take it out again for 30 years because you're way too close to it yeah so I've now finally written it 30 years later.,0.91,148
1,718,6265.338,6274.073,Yeah you probably still too close to it though I don't know though I mean.,0.91,148
1,719,6274.601,6275.63,"I do think like,",0.81,148
1,720,6275.664,6287.559,"I think everybody goes through experiences in this life where you're experiencing like a fundamental pain of separation and desire for a union and it takes so many different forms,",0.9,148
1,721,6287.592,6298.02,"and this was my Primal form of it but you know for someone else it's a betrayal or a bereavement or an exile from a country of their birth or whatever it is,",0.8200000000000001,148
1,722,6298.169,6309.803,but then you get to solve that puzzle for for the for the rest of your life yeah active like I really do believe that you know that the original love that.,0.74,148
1,723,6310.115,6314.467,We long for like that one of the great things that you learn as you grow older is that though.,0.89,148
1,724,6315.057,6325.197,That the love exists in some plane that's more General than the particularized form in which you first knew it yeah I mean that's why despite all the creepy interpretations with.,0.81,149
1,725,6325.663,6333.182,But even though Sigmund Freud is probably wrong in the details he was the first one to sort of suggest that,0.85,149
1,726,6333.144,6336.567,"our experiences give me he said that,",0.88,149
1,727,6336.609,6351.114,that was really controversial at the time when young people they start having sexual thoughts I could gauge to or something whatever the hell he said so you develop this kind of connection to do the opposite sex or whatever did your mother to your parents.,0.8200000000000001,149
1,728,6352.426,6358.389,"And I think a lot of that is shown to be probably not true what is,",0.8300000000000001,150
1,729,6358.529,6370.776,like a deeper truth there's your first early experiences of Love or depth of connection and probably some how strongly formative of your conception of love and your definition.,0.91,150
1,730,6371.403,6379.13,Of the perfect thing you're reaching for for the rest of your life yeah I think that's right and you can really see it when you become a parent too.,0.85,151
1,731,6379.397,6392.012,You know you can just see things like there's those screwed up you know I have to say it like I mean knock on wood I actually feel like like we're doing pretty well like my kids are teenagers now and.,0.73,151
1,732,6392.63,6401.032,I really had thought that I wasn't going to repeat the issues that I had been through with my mom and I can say I really am not.,0.9,151
1,733,6401.471,6408.882,Yeah like my mom for various reasons just had a lot of trouble with my Independence and I just don't feel that at all.,0.91,151
1,734,6409.114,6414.67,"So yeah they might there might be other things you're totally blind too,",0.77,151
1,735,6414.776,6427.202,I guess that's possible is that the way of parenting is you solve the problems of the past but there's that matter anyone he did ride find out and enter 20 years but like so far so good what was them,0.8200000000000001,151
1,736,6427.01,6431.487,but parenting can you keep can you give from your own experience and from your writing.,0.79,151
1,737,6431.844,6441.417,Yeah well oh my God there's a lot to say so on the Bittersweet side of things the wisdom that I would give is.,0.91,151
1,738,6442.539,6452.345,"That
especially for kids who are growing up in relative comfort with everything going pretty well,",0.91,152
1,739,6452.486,6455.172,they get the idea that.,0.91,152
1,740,6455.898,6469.639,Real life is when things are going well and when things don't go well it's like a detour from the main road as opposed to understanding that it's all the main road and I tell the story in the book of.,0.91,153
1,741,6470.131,6476.12,This time that we went on the family vacation where we rented a house in the countryside and.,0.88,153
1,742,6476.613,6485.717,The house was next to this field where we're lived two donkeys that our kids fell in love with they were like really little at the time two boys and.,0.8200000000000001,153
1,743,6486.065,6500.183,They're spending all this time feeding carrots to the donkeys and it's all beautiful and then comes the day where they realize that we're leaving in like two days and they're never going to see these donkeys again and they start crying themselves to sleep and the usual things that.,0.89,153
1,744,6500.64,6510.356,Parents might say at a moment like that of like you know maybe we'll come back or another family will feed them will feed these donkeys none of that made any difference.,0.8300000000000001,153
1,745,6510.623,6512.633,But when we said to them.,0.91,153
1,746,6512.981,6526.488,"You know goodbye is part of life and this feeling you're having everybody has it you've had it before you're going to have it again you'll feel better in a couple days,",0.91,153
1,747,6526.593,6531.998,but this is the way it's supposed to be this is natural that's when they stopped crying because.,0.8200000000000001,153
1,748,6532.606,6542.26,I think that's when they stopped resisting yeah like it's one thing to feel the pain of goodbye and it's another thing to be feeling like this isn't supposed to be happening.,0.91,154
1,749,6542.644,6556.178,If the resistance part of this isn't supposed to be happening that makes life really difficult yeah as I said you're more clear-eyed view of what it really is this isn't he supposed to be happening there's a show called Yellowstone as recently started watching,0.9,154
1,750,6556.084,6568.997,yeah I know I've heard of it we actually started watching it but only a few minutes and didn't get into it so there's just a quick it's not a spoiler of any kind but there's a father taking out the Sun for the first time to go hunting and,0.81,154
1,751,6568.967,6571.652,you know the shooter first buck and.,0.68,154
1,752,6572.927,6579.61,The sun is get really sad because he pulls the trigger and he took a life and the father says that.,0.79,155
1,753,6580.075,6588.766,Everybody gets killed in this life that's the way of nature that's the way each one of us is going to get killed and.,0.91,155
1,754,6589.267,6597.462,It's interesting because I didn't really think of it that way because you think you died but he really framed it as killed,0.8300000000000001,155
1,755,6597.414,6608.589,hmm because he's like there's no such thing as dying of old age that's medically let's discuss that a bit but basically there's something whether it's.,0.9,155
1,756,6609.0,6615.196,A truck or a bacteria something is going.,0.88,155
1,757,6615.617,6623.19,Kill you in the end and that was an interesting way to look at it because we tend to think of humans aren't.,0.91,155
1,758,6623.926,6631.562,"Are supposed to be killed we think of murder is one of the sins that have one of the things that you don't do in society but you know what,",0.8300000000000001,156
1,759,6631.676,6635.181,we do that the more technical discussion whether we,0.9,156
1,760,6634.989,6651.592,"ultimate get killed by something in the end but it to some degree that's true at least for most of us that there's something that gets is whether it's cancer those kinds of things it's interesting but yeah it's that reframing of this not it's supposed to be this is the way of the world yeah,",0.8300000000000001,156
1,761,6651.689,6660.559,it's funny I mean you know at the same time that I just wrote a whole book about the fact that this is the way it is like I really do believe this is the way it is and,0.73,156
1,762,6660.52,6664.141,and with this reality there's an intense beauty that comes along with it.,0.91,156
1,763,6664.643,6671.973,So we have to accept the reality to get to the beauty I believe that and at the same time there's a part of me that's just like.,0.79,156
1,764,6672.276,6676.259,Yeah but give me the magic wand make the world different yeah.,0.91,156
1,765,6676.58,6691.329,Yeah yeah no I don't know how much of this is a female thing to like I was watching with my son and my 12 year old the other day we were watching this show about the Battle of Thermopylae and yeah and it was like all about you know,0.8300000000000001,156
1,766,6691.28,6701.222,Valor and glory on the battlefield and and I said to him something like gosh don't you just wish we lived in a world where.,0.91,156
1,767,6702.227,6704.859,You didn't have to do all this in order for everyone,0.79,157
1,768,6704.847,6715.832,just to live their lives just looked at me completely puzzled like no you know like to him it all just seemed self-evident that the world would be structured that way,0.8300000000000001,157
1,769,6715.784,6724.763,and he had like the twelve-year-old like admiration for the dollar of it all but you wonder if that's if that's.,0.79,157
1,770,6725.003,6730.911,"Nature or nurture
I wonder what that world looks like.",0.91,157
1,771,6731.484,6744.919,We do live in a world where murder scene as bad but you look at a lot of the human history I don't know if they had the same kind of conception of that in terms of the you have to ask,0.87,157
1,772,6744.781,6752.445,what kind of murder you know for what purpose you know war was a way of life.,0.86,157
1,773,6752.685,6759.836,It's interesting it's interesting if we can imagine properly a future that is.,0.91,157
1,774,6760.715,6771.836,Different than ours in terms of operating under the different moral systems I'd like saying with living indefinitely Or living in a society with no war.,0.8300000000000001,158
1,775,6772.958,6774.842,Like how fundamental is war.,0.8300000000000001,159
1,776,6775.361,6788.751,How fundamentals death I mean I think it's so fundamental to our source code I just wish that our source code were different basically like I can't get people already have that wish there's there's brain computer interfaces that try to merge.,0.84,159
1,777,6789.54,6799.4,"So greater and greater with smartphones were already kind of cyborgs but greater and greater merger of computational power so literally,",0.84,160
1,778,6799.452,6809.465,adding source code to our original source code just a different there's the mushy biology that runs source code and then there's more cold electrical,0.91,160
1,779,6809.372,6813.687,systems and then they integrate together and potentially.,0.81,160
1,780,6814.153,6820.412,"One day we offload
the magic that is human consciousness",0.91,160
1,781,6820.391,6833.834,also into the machine and then we'll get to see maybe maybe they'll be a little bit less asshole issue about the whole War thing that be more but there is I think even when I engine when I think about engineering.,0.8300000000000001,160
1,782,6834.453,6840.91,Human intelligence are superhuman intelligence systems I feel like they also need to have the yin yang of life.,0.73,161
1,783,6841.114,6848.769,They have to be able to be afraid and to be sad and all those kinds of things but maybe it's because I'm.,0.9,161
1,784,6849.135,6857.474,"A product in this particular environment maybe sadness is a human useful human invention but not a universal one,",0.91,161
1,785,6857.615,6868.691,this is what I don't know because this is where I come back to the as I told you like the original reason that I wrote my whole book was the feeling that somehow in the expression of sad music.,0.8300000000000001,161
1,786,6868.994,6876.964,Is what other people see when they talk about God like there's something so there's like an ultimate Beauty there.,0.89,161
1,787,6877.276,6881.231,Yeah but I don't know if we have access to without that but maybe we do.,0.75,161
1,788,6882.011,6890.143,But I can't say in this world it's a great way to get access to that state is it within the reach of science to deeply understand this you think.,0.9,162
1,789,6890.627,6898.362,To understand that why he feel sad when you listen to a song for why you feel loved when you're listening to a sad sound to us as all right yeah.,0.79,162
1,790,6898.53,6909.409,Why the sad why the sad song opens up some kind of deep connection to something you can call Divine or something whatever the heck that is yeah,0.91,162
1,791,6909.396,6922.777,"I do think I mean we have like really early signs of it from the research and I'm sure we're just at the yeah scratching the surface stage but I mean like we know for example that you know the vagus nerve which,",0.85,162
1,792,6922.873,6926.26,it's so fundamental that governs our breathing and digestion.,0.8,162
1,793,6926.78,6933.111,"Are vagus nerve also activates when we see another being in distress there's like a,",0.6900000000000001,162
1,794,6933.243,6937.316,"instinctive impulse to want to make it stop,",0.91,162
1,795,6937.457,6951.737,and the theory is that that's an evolutionary design because we had to be able to respond to the cries of our infants you know and from that ability grows the greater ability to respond to other people's cries too so.,0.9,162
1,796,6952.508,6959.056,"That's probably just you know
like the very first step in being able to understand what all that is,",0.9,163
1,797,6959.197,6966.023,"we've already given plenty of advice but broadly what advice would you give to Young Folks,",0.91,163
1,798,6966.047,6979.149,today about career about life whether they want to be writers lawyers scientists musicians and artists whatever the heck they want to be how can they live a life that can be proud of,0.91,163
1,799,6979.02,6983.11,okay here's what I think.,0.91,163
1,800,6983.557,6989.196,He's an absolutely do that thing that you're dying to do.,0.91,163
1,801,6989.57,7002.537,"But you should always have a plan B and it like a back-up plan and a way of earning a living no matter what happens because funny I feel like people,",0.91,163
1,802,7002.687,7014.014,"we have this narrative in our culture of like that the Glamorous thing is to figure out the thing you love and then Risk Everything to achieve that but,",0.89,163
1,803,7014.138,7019.623,first of all a lot of people aren't comfortable with that level of risk and second when you're living with that level of risk.,0.91,163
1,804,7020.413,7028.5,That's a cognitive load too and so you don't have the full emotion and heart to be able to focus on the thing that you actually really love because your.,0.78,164
1,805,7028.793,7033.757,Stressed out about it so I'd say like can't the back-up plan in place and then do the thing.,0.8200000000000001,164
1,806,7034.96,7044.479,My advice would be the opposite huh okay I'm I'm leaving like the Romantic well I think the best the the truth is be.,0.85,165
1,807,7044.881,7046.963,Aware the cost.,0.9,165
1,808,7047.149,7056.839,Not having a plan B has to do it deliberately if you don't but I you know I would be cows can find what you love and let it kill you I think.,0.85,165
1,809,7057.276,7061.6,Now you have to actually know your personality I know if I have a plan B.,0.8200000000000001,165
1,810,7062.039,7067.659,I will not try as hard on plan a and I would likely take Plan B.,0.8,166
1,811,7067.846,7075.851,"Because if plan is is the risky thing hmm I just work way much better one in the state of desperation,",0.87,166
1,812,7075.984,7086.114,"so with my back against the wall and you have to know that about yourself I think that has to do I think we can refine it to say you actually have to really know yourself and how you respond to different kinds of risk,",0.77,166
1,813,7086.129,7090.777,like I would not do well in that kind of situation I'd be like up at two in the morning,0.87,166
1,814,7090.666,7099.581,worrying about it yeah we're as if I have something like it doesn't have to be paying the rent in some Grand way but if there's some basic way of paying the rent,0.77,166
1,815,7099.507,7106.918,then my heart's create do the thing I really love that's hilarious I for me the only way I'm free is.,0.84,166
1,816,7107.194,7114.543,"When I don't know how I'm going to be the right huh yeah cuz that's because otherwise I'll,",0.73,166
1,817,7114.603,7118.252,find a way to pay the rent that's not at all,0.91,166
1,818,7118.213,7127.452,a source of deep fulfillment for me so I stay so it's like if you don't have like the what's the expression I don't know something like the dog at your back yeah,0.71,166
1,819,7127.395,7141.658,"deadline and you won't actually do it I agree real or artificial deadlines anxiety and so on so yeah you have to if yeah so the advice is know your triggers but yeah but we're still saying that the same basic thing of like,",0.84,166
1,820,7141.745,7143.674,do the thing you really love it.,0.86,166
1,821,7144.364,7152.056,Fed Up the strategy as the rest of your life early to your personality exactly exactly what do you think is the meaning of life.,0.8,167
1,822,7152.475,7157.718,The meaning of this whole thing probably has something to do with.,0.91,167
1,823,7159.038,7163.687,Whatever we feel when we listen to us that song yeah.,0.9,168
1,824,7164.547,7177.757,Because two things come simultaneously to my mind when you ask that question I've been asking it since I was four I remember the first time I did the question is more important than the answer probably yeah keep asking.,0.9,169
1,825,7178.033,7185.175,I don't know the first one is Beauty and I don't know why Beauty so important but I just know that it is impossible to Define perhaps.,0.79,169
1,826,7185.523,7192.467,"Is it definable yeah
other than you know it when you see it I don't know I mean just.",0.81,169
1,827,7194.147,7203.494,Has to do with that line you feel something when you just see it or hear it yeah you just see it and it's like like some it's.,0.9,170
1,828,7203.86,7211.498,Whatever can delivery to that mode of transcendence where you're no longer purely in your own self and.,0.91,170
1,829,7211.935,7216.791,You're in something higher and when you're in those states of mind.,0.91,170
1,830,7217.445,7222.525,You know it because you have the temporary Sensation that.,0.91,170
1,831,7222.882,7229.664,That you could die at that moment that the people you love could die and it will all be okay because there's something else.,0.88,170
1,832,7230.534,7235.03,So that's my first answer and then the second answer is,0.8200000000000001,171
1,833,7234.972,7246.102,the need to relieve psychic pain I was like other people psychic pain I don't know why that's just that's just like an Impulse that I have psychic pain is more like like suffering of any form.,0.8200000000000001,171
1,834,7246.351,7252.394,"Yeah but I mean
what is there a particular yeah just making the world.",0.8,171
1,835,7254.021,7256.959,"Better and less pain,",0.91,172
1,836,7257.001,7270.471,"let's paint to go around in general as you're just sort of optimistic desire and longing for a world without sort of Destruction without malevolent destruction,",0.6000000000000001,172
1,837,7270.523,7278.213,yeah we're all very aware that wouldn't be necessary yeah exactly exactly but yeah like I so I had this moment.,0.74,172
1,838,7279.11,7285.901,It wasn't so long ago I was doing some interview and somebody asked me like what are you longing for right now and.,0.8300000000000001,173
1,839,7286.168,7295.579,My answer that moment was like you know what I'm actually at this moment in life where I'm not longing for anything I'm at this particular Way Station where everything.,0.89,173
1,840,7295.819,7298.513,Is the way I want it to be and.,0.91,173
1,841,7299.807,7307.039,Of course the minute you say something like that you know you're going to be proven wrong because like an hour later I get a letter from.,0.91,174
1,842,7307.602,7315.798,A reader who have been in touch with over the years and he was telling me about like a state as I kick struggle that he's going through and.,0.8200000000000001,174
1,843,7316.704,7320.542,"I just thought oh my gosh if there anything I could do to make it that,",0.78,175
1,844,7320.692,7328.122,his life wouldn't have been such that he would be in this position in the first place like his struggles had to do with a long life history.,0.91,175
1,845,7329.721,7342.589,So I don't know why I feel that it's funny but I do those moments when you were just at peace there's nothing else you want feel like that's like a temporary Repose like it was exactly,0.89,176
1,846,7342.523,7345.523,you could you bet your ass.,0.91,176
1,847,7345.836,7357.091,A desire follows that at some point but you get to enjoy those little moments yeah I took me when I say that even when he asked me and I answered that way I said this is a Way Station like I knew it was temporary,0.87,176
1,848,7356.962,7363.131,but I didn't realize it would be disrupted like an hour later and said of to give you push back.,0.84,176
1,849,7363.381,7370.847,To your to your statement about the possibility of creating because she a beauty.,0.8200000000000001,176
1,850,7371.194,7385.043,And basically alleviating suffering is a quarterly like from Hunter and styles to the pushes back against that which is for every moment of Triumph for every instance of beauty many Souls must be trampled.,0.81,176
1,851,7385.68,7388.032,But that's a very Hunter as Thompson,0.84,177
1,852,7387.903,7397.772,you know how yeah yeah yeah it's not the greatest philosopher all of all times but he certainly beautiful a chaotic human being,0.76,177
1,853,7397.653,7407.495,well that's true and I will tell you that my nickname for my husband is gonzo kind of because of him you know he invented that form of Gonzo journalism where like the.,0.8300000000000001,177
1,854,7407.825,7417.218,"The writer is totally in the story and my husband's like that's his personality he's in everything that he does he's really in it he's really,",0.85,177
1,855,7417.278,7424.437,he just lived that way so well then there was name is Ken but I call him Gonzo like 90% of the time,0.91,177
1,856,7424.281,7432.692,well then it's a beautiful way to end the season this is thank you for your work thank you for being who you are thanking you for initially at least making me,0.8300000000000001,177
1,857,7432.545,7442.469,feel okay about being an introvert and educating and making the rest of us feel great about being introverts it's like half the world or whatever the heck it is it's a lot of people,0.91,177
1,858,7442.439,7451.129,thank you for being you thank you for talking to Dale this is awesome this is fun thank you so much it was so great to talk to you and I think it was the.,0.79,177
1,859,7451.297,7460.752,What I said to you when we first got connected is thank you for your way of being in the world I really really love it thanks for listening to this conversation with Susan Cain.,0.7000000000000001,177
1,860,7461.029,7468.755,Support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from Susan Cain herself.,0.89,177
1,861,7469.617,7481.592,The highly sensitive introvert tends to be philosophical or spiritual and their orientation rather than materialistic or hedonistic they dislike small talk.,0.88,178
1,862,7482.093,7490.0,They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive they dream vividly and can often recall their dreams the next day.,0.91,178
1,863,7490.439,7494.492,They love music nature art and physical Beauty.,0.8200000000000001,178
1,864,7495.12,7503.117,If you'll accept really strong emotions sometimes acute bouts of Joy but also sorrow Melancholy and fear.,0.9,178
1,865,7503.708,7511.174,Highly sensitive people also process information about their environments both physical and emotional unusually deeply.,0.91,178
1,866,7511.783,7521.274,They tend to notice so these that others miss another person's shifted mood or a light bulb burning a Touch Too brightly.,0.81,178
1,867,7522.478,7525.73,Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.,0.85,179
1,868,7526.96,7542.264,Music.,,180
2,0,0.018000000000000002,6.398,The following is a conversation with demouth casabas CEO and co-founder of deepmind.,0.8,1
2,1,6.602,16.615,A company that has published and build some of the most incredible artificial intelligence systems in the history of computing including Al 40 that learned.,0.88,1
2,2,16.828,30.299,All by itself to play the game of Go better than any human in the world and Alpha fold to that's solved protein folding both tasks considered nearly impossible for a very long time.,0.9,1
2,3,31.088,40.678,Thomas is widely considered to be one of the most brilliant and impactful humans in the history of artificial intelligence and Science and Engineering in general.,0.8,2
2,4,40.873,50.563,This was truly an honor and a pleasure for me to finally sit down with him for this conversation and I'm sure we'll talk many times again in the future.,0.88,2
2,5,51.982,64.165,And now a quick view second mention if we sponsor check them out in the description that's the best way to support this podcast we got mailgun for email campaigns inside tracker for longevity on it for supplements,0.8,3
2,6,64.018,72.609,indeed for hiring and Magic spoon for breakfast she was wise to my friends and now I want to the full ad reads as always no ads the middle,0.86,3
2,7,72.498,79.082,I try to make this interesting but if you skip them please do check out our sponsors I enjoy their stuff maybe you will too.,0.88,3
2,8,79.736,93.846,This show is brought to you by mailgun by cinch and email delivery service that I've used for many many years to have an API that allows you to programmatically send emails if you don't know what an API is the point is.,0.74,4
2,9,93.861,99.607,It's a way for programs for code to interact with the service.,0.9,4
2,10,99.991,106.503,You have an API for both transactional and marketing emails those are terms used by people,0.85,5
2,11,106.338,125.137,much smarter about the stuff than me but I think transactional means specific to the person emails which is what I guess used its way to email certain people to notify them about the status of whatever the heck they're doing on the website and then there's marketing emails which is when you send an email,0.8200000000000001,5
2,12,124.954,130.116,to a lot of people like the same email I guess transactional is super customized,0.84,5
2,13,130.086,137.336,to an action that a person took and marketing is like a push email that you sent a lot of people in both of those,0.86,5
2,14,137.297,150.002,two categories of how people often use email and so mailgun is service that makes it super easy for you to do that kind of thing you can go to Lex Friedman.com mailgun to learn more.,0.89,5
2,15,151.457,159.364,This show is also brought to you by inside tracker a service that used to track biological data data that comes from my body.,0.91,6
2,16,159.424,168.123,A lot of their plans that you can send out for include blood tests why blood test because a lot of really useful data comes from your blood and then they use.,0.79,6
2,17,168.354,181.519,Machine learning algorithms to analyze that data so that includes blood data DNA data and even data from your Fitness tracker to provide you a clear picture what's going on inside your body this is the future,0.86,6
2,18,181.489,185.021,anything you decide to do in your life should be based on data.,0.91,6
2,19,185.216,194.356,From your entity from your being that means your biological body maybe one day that means from your brain as well.,0.91,6
2,20,194.497,202.827,There'll be a brain computer interface device like neural link that collects data from your brain and is able to make suggestions.,0.76,6
2,21,203.346,207.085,What kind of supplements to take what kind of dye changes to make.,0.86,7
2,22,207.478,214.701,You can go to inside track a.com slash Lex and for a limited time you get special savings for being a listener of this very podcast.,0.8300000000000001,8
2,23,215.364,223.55,This episode is also brought to you by on it and nutrition supplement and fitness company they have a thing called Alpha Brain which is a nootropic,0.91,9
2,24,223.448,232.444,that helps you with the memory metal speed and focus you might know it because of mr. Joe Rogan which is probably the first time.,0.84,9
2,25,232.865,240.574,I heard an honored read is one of the first podcast actually Joe's that I listen to.,0.8200000000000001,10
2,26,241.273,247.289,Religiously I'm a huge fan of audiobooks and podcasts in general but there's something about.,0.84,11
2,27,247.538,254.203,The authenticity the Joe projects that immediately connected with me and overtime,0.8,12
2,28,254.137,263.727,his ability to be curious and apathetic a good listener but also be able to change his mind keep an open mind just some crazy ideas anyway,0.88,12
2,29,263.589,274.251,I mentioned that because The Joe Rogan Experience introduced me to a lot of these kinds of products like on it that quickly became part of my life I guess podcast ad reads work.,0.8200000000000001,12

2,44,411.911,421.051,This is a lot screaming podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's damus casabas.,0.89,21
2,45,422.32,436.4,Music.,,22
2,46,436.244,446.059,Let's start with a bit of a personal question am I an AI program you wrote to interview people until I get good enough to interview you.,0.85,23
2,47,446.101,454.512,Well I've been pressed if you are being pressed by myself if you were I don't think we're quite up to that yet but maybe you're from the future Lex.,0.91,23
2,48,454.645,460.634,If you did would you tell me is that is that a good thing to tell a language model that's tasked with interviewing.,0.86,23
2,49,460.955,468.376,That it is in fact a I maybe when I kind of met her during test probably probably would be a good idea not to tell you,0.75,24
2,50,468.301,476.883,so it doesn't change your behavior right this is a kind of Eisenberg uncertainty principle situation if I told you you behave differently yeah maybe that's what's happening with us of course,0.81,24
2,51,476.826,484.787,this is a benchmark from the future where they replay 2022 as a year before a eyes were good enough.,0.84,24
2,52,484.892,488.847,Yeah and now we want to see is it going to pass exactly.,0.91,24
2,53,489.807,498.498,If I was such a program would you be able to tell do you think so to the Turing test question you've talked about.,0.8300000000000001,25
2,54,499.152,507.5,The Benchmark for solving intelligence what would be the impressive thing you talked about winning a Nobel Prize in a system winning a Nobel Prize,0.87,26
2,55,507.299,513.324,but I still return to the Turing test as a compelling test the spirit of the Turing test isn't compelling test,0.81,26
2,56,513.15,528.799,yeah the cheering test of course it's been unbelievably influential and turing's one of my all-time Heroes but I think if you look back at the 1950 papers original paper and read the original you'll see I don't think you meant it to be a rigorous formal test I think it was more like a thought experiment,0.77,26
2,57,528.733,538.774,almost a bit of philosophy he was writing if you look at the style of the paper and you can see didn't specify it very rigorously flow for example he didn't specify the knowledge that the expert,0.87,26
2,58,538.645,543.077,or judge would have not been a how much time would they have to,0.78,26
2,59,542.984,552.502,investigate this so these important parameters if you're going to make it a true sort of formal test and you know some by some measures,0.81,26
2,60,552.49,554.294,people claim the Turing test passed,0.79,26
2,61,554.273,564.304,several you know decade ago I remember someone claiming that with a kind of very bog-standard normal logic model because they pretended it was a it was a kid.,0.79,26
2,62,564.31,566.159,So the the judges thought.,0.81,26
2,63,566.21,577.6,That the machine you know was was a child so that would be very different from an expert a i person interrogating machine and knowing how it was built and so on so I think.,0.84,27
2,64,577.615,591.815,You know we should probably move away from that as a formal test and move more towards General test where we test the AI capabilities on a range of tasks and see if it reaches human level or above performance on,0.85,27
2,65,591.749,598.981,maybe thousands perhaps even millions of tasks eventually and cover the entire sort of cognitive space so I think.,0.9,27
2,66,599.068,607.263,For its time it was an amazing thought experiment and also 1950s obviously there's barely the dawn of the computer age so of course he only thought about text.,0.91,28
2,67,607.332,616.292,And now we have a lot more different inputs so yeah maybe the better thing to test is the generalizability so across multiple tasks but,0.91,28
2,68,616.136,621.378,I think it's also possible as as systems like God will show that.,0.85,28
2,69,621.439,628.76,Eventually that might map right back to language so you might be able to demonstrate your ability to generalize across tasks.,0.8,28
2,70,629.117,639.572,By then communicating your ability to generalize across tasks which is kind of what we do through conversation anyway when we jump around ultimately what's in there in that conversation.,0.91,29
2,71,639.614,642.363,Is not just you moving around knowledge.,0.84,29
2,72,642.891,652.742,It's you moving around like this entirely different modalities of understanding that ultimately we mapped to your ability to.,0.84,30
2,73,652.847,662.627,To operate successfully in all of these domains which you can think of as tasks yeah I think certainly we as humans use language as our main,0.89,30
2,74,662.561,674.015,generalization communication tool so I think we end up thinking in language and expressing our Solutions in language so it's going to be very powerful mode,0.77,30
2,75,673.886,680.811,and which to explain you know the system to explain what it's doing but I don't think it's the only.,0.8300000000000001,30
2,76,680.889,690.75,Modality that matters so I think there's going to be a lot of you know there's a lot of different ways to express capabilities are other than just language.,0.87,30
2,77,691.449,694.99,Visual robotics body language,0.74,31
2,78,694.987,704.397,yeah actions the interactive aspect of all that that's all part of it but what's interesting with got so is that it's a it's it's sort of,0.86,31
2,79,704.34,716.325,pushing prediction to the maximum in terms of like you know mapping arbitrary sequences to other sequences and sort of just predicting what's going to happen next so prediction seems to be fundamental to intelligence.,0.88,31
2,80,716.881,720.565,And what you're predicting doesn't so much matter yeah,0.8300000000000001,32
2,81,720.527,729.442,it seems like you can generalize that quite well so obviously language models predict the next word Gatto predicts potentially any action or any token,0.89,32
2,82,729.421,740.037,and it's just the beginning really it's a most General agent one could call it so far but you know that itself can be scaled up massively more than we've done so far I'm obviously we're in the in the middle of doing that.,0.85,32
2,83,740.097,753.361,But the big part of solving a GI is creating benchmarks that help us get closer and closer sort of creating benchmarks that test the generalizability and it's just still interesting that this fella,0.8200000000000001,32
2,84,753.286,759.662,Alan Turing was one of the first and probably still one of the only people that was trying.,0.91,32
2,85,759.776,765.748,Maybe philosophically both trying to formulate a benchmark that could be followed it is even though,0.8200000000000001,32
2,86,765.691,776.28,it's fuzzy is still sufficiently rigorous to where you can run that test and I still think something like the Turing test will end at the end of the day be the thing that truly,0.84,32
2,87,776.215,780.44,impresses other humans so that you can have a close friend.,0.91,32
2,88,780.662,787.047,Who's in the eye system for that friend to be a good friend they're going to have to be able to,0.74,33
2,89,787.035,793.763,play Starcraft and they're going to have to do all of these tasks get you a beer,0.84,33
2,90,793.697,801.748,so the core products tasks play games with you use language humor all those kinds of things but that,0.91,33
2,91,801.565,821.778,ultimately can boil down to language it feels like in not in terms of the AI Community but in terms of the actual impact of general intelligence on the world it feels like language will be the place or truly shines I think sorry because it's such an important kind of input output for us I think you're right I think the cheering test that what the the kind of,0.8,33
2,92,821.604,830.087,the the philosophy behind it which is the idea of can can a machine mimic the behaviors of a human.,0.9,33
2,93,830.201,839.386,Amen and I would say wider than just language and text then you know in terms of actions and everything else creativity all these things then,0.81,33
2,94,839.257,851.503,if it can sort of match or exceed human cognitive capabilities then I think we have a you know true intelligence so I thought from that perspective you're right I think he did formulate the right kind of setup.,0.87,33
2,95,851.554,854.627,I just I think there will be a kind of humor.,0.72,33
2,96,855.083,864.611,In the AI systems the future looking back to this conversation and thinking about the Turing test and also thinking about,0.81,34
2,97,864.473,875.593,by that time they would know which year they were finally able to sort of cross the threshold of human level intelligence and think how funny it is that we humans were still,0.91,34
2,98,875.492,885.19,confused about this whole problem have this really long ago been solved hello to the AI agents of the future anyway so good going back to your.,0.86,34
2,99,885.286,893.481,To your journey when did you fall in love with programming first well it's pretty pretty young age actually so,0.91,34
2,100,893.361,907.975,you know I started off actually games as my first love so starting to play chess when I was around four years old and then is actually with winnings from a chess competition that I managed to buy my first chess computer when I was about eight years old was I said expectrum.,0.86,34
2,101,907.999,913.394,Which was hugely popular in the UK at the time and is amazing machine because,0.84,34
2,102,913.274,918.3,I think it chant trained a whole generation of programmers in the UK because it was so accessible.,0.75,34
2,103,918.378,923.837,You know you literally switched it on and there was the basic prompt and you could just get going and.,0.8200000000000001,34
2,104,923.888,933.937,My parents didn't really know anything about computers so but because it was my money from a chess competition I could I could say I could I wanted to buy it and then you know I just went to bookstores.,0.85,34
2,105,934.177,940.986,Books on programming and started typing in you know that the programming code and and then of course,0.91,35
2,106,940.812,950.726,um once you start doing that you start adjusting it and then making your own games and that's when I fell in love with computers and realize that they were very magical device,0.91,35
2,107,950.715,962.078,in a way I kind of it I don't want have been able to explain this at the time but I felt that they were sort of almost a magical extension of your mind I always had this feeling and I've always loved this about computers that you can set them off doing something,0.81,35
2,108,961.967,967.183,some task for you you can go to sleep come back the next day and it's solved,0.72,35
2,109,967.099,977.247,you know that feels a magical to me so I mean all machines do that to some extent they all enhance our natural capabilities obviously cars makers allow us to move faster than we can run.,0.91,35
2,110,977.316,987.222,This was a machine to extend the mind and and then of course AI is the ultimate expression of what a machine may be able to do or learn,0.89,35
2,111,987.219,994.126,so very naturally for me that thought extended into into a i quite quickly remember the the programming language.,0.87,35
2,112,994.403,1005.667,That was first started in yes but so special to the machine oh no it was just a nice it was just a basic it was just basic on the ZX Spectrum I don't know what specific format was and then later on I got a Commodore amiga,0.8300000000000001,36
2,113,1005.475,1006.649,quit chefs,0.52,36
2,114,1006.457,1021.313,it was a fantastic machine now you're just showing off so yeah well lots of my friends had a Tory STS and I managed to get a me because it was a bit more powerful and and that was incredible and used to do programming in assembler and and also,0.8200000000000001,36
2,115,1021.274,1030.757,a most basic this this this specific form of basic it was incredible actually so while all my coding skills and when did you fall in love with AI so when did you first.,0.87,36
2,116,1031.312,1040.038,Start to gain understanding that you can not just write programs that do some mathematical operations for you while you sleep but something that's.,0.8300000000000001,37
2,117,1040.422,1051.759,A keen to bringing an entity to life sort of a thing that can figure out something more complicated than a than a simple mathematical operation.,0.74,38
2,118,1051.765,1057.763,Yeah so that was a few stages for me or what I was very young so first of all as I was trying to improve,0.8,38
2,119,1057.734,1066.351,playing chess I was Captain embarrassing Regina chest teams and at the time when I was about you know maybe 10 11 years old I was going to become a professional chess player that was my first.,0.72,38
2,120,1066.448,1080.134,I thought the dream was there to sure she'll try to get to the highest level yes so I was you know I got to when I was about 12 years old I got two masters dad and I was second highest rated player in the world to Judit Polgar who obviously ended up being,0.72,38
2,121,1080.068,1081.421,an amazing chess player.,0.91,38
2,122,1081.608,1090.955,And World women's champion and when I was trying to improve it chest where you know what you do is you obviously first of all you're trying to improve your own thinking processes.,0.85,38
2,123,1091.015,1097.85,So that leads you to thinking about thinking how is your brain coming up with these ideas why is it making mistakes,0.91,38
2,124,1097.803,1104.458,how can you how can you improve that thought process but the second thing is that you it was just the beginning this is like in the,0.84,38
2,125,1104.446,1111.3,in the early 80s mid 80s of Chess computers if you remember they were physical balls like the one we have in front of us and Pew press down the.,0.8,38
2,126,1111.378,1117.106,You know this the squares and I think Kasparov had a branded version of it that I got,0.8300000000000001,39
2,127,1116.86,1132.392,and you will you know used to that they're not as strong as they are today but they were they were pretty strong and used to practice against them to try and improve your openings and other things and so I remember I think I probably got my first one was around 11 or 12 and I remember thinking,0.8200000000000001,39
2,128,1132.164,1136.488,this amazing you know how our someone programmed this,0.79,39
2,129,1136.305,1144.716,this chess board to play chess and it was very informative book I bought which was called the chess computer handbook by David Levy.,0.78,39
2,130,1144.722,1157.166,His hand came out 1984 something so I must have got it when I was about 11 12 in explained fully how these chess programs are made and I remember my first day I program being programmed mi amiga it couldn't.,0.87,39
2,131,1157.199,1165.377,It wasn't powerful enough to play chess I couldn't write a whole chess program but I wrote a program for it to play Othello with us it's sometimes called I think in the US,0.91,39
2,132,1165.176,1175.882,and so slightly simpler game than chess but I used all of the principles that chess programs had alpha-beta total of that and that was my first AI program remember that very well is around 12 years old so that.,0.79,39
2,133,1175.951,1184.524,That brought me into a i and then the second part was later on when I was around 16 17 and I was writing games professionally designing games,0.71,39
2,134,1184.305,1195.327,writing a game called theme park which had a i as a co-op gameplay component as part of the simulation and it sold you know millions of copies around the world and people loved.,0.77,39
2,135,1195.468,1203.483,The way that the AI even though it's relatively simple by today's AI standards was was reacting to the way you as the player played it.,0.87,40
2,136,1203.561,1211.162,So I was a called a Sandbox game so it's one of the first types of games like that along with SimCity and it meant that every game you played was unique.,0.77,40
2,137,1211.276,1219.795,Is there something you could say just a small tangent about really impressive AI from a game design.,0.91,40
2,138,1219.999,1234.208,Human enjoyment perspective really impressive AI that you've seen in games and maybe what does it take to create a system and how hard of a problem is that so I'm a million questions we would just as a brief tangent,0.8300000000000001,41
2,139,1234.187,1236.026,well look I think,0.77,41
2,140,1235.96,1251.474,games games have been significant in my life for three reasons so first of all to I was playing them and training myself on games when I was a kid then I went through a phase of designing games and writing AI for games all the games I professionally wrote,0.86,41
2,141,1251.255,1255.894,had a always a core component and that was mostly in the in the 90s.,0.8200000000000001,41
2,142,1255.918,1262.961,And the reason I was doing that in games industry was at the time the games industry I think was The Cutting Edge of Technology.,0.8300000000000001,41
2,143,1263.057,1276.041,So whether it was graphics with people like John Carmack and Quake and those kind of things or a I I think actually all the action was going on in games and and we seen we're still reaping the benefits of that even with things like gpus,0.8,42
2,144,1276.038,1291.858,which you know I find ironic was obviously invented for graphics computer Graphics but then turns out to be amazingly useful for a I could just turns out everything's a matrix multiplication appear it appears they're in the wind the whole world so so I think games at the time had the most cutting-edge AI,0.89,42
2,145,1291.639,1301.563,and a lot of the games are we you know I was involved in writing so there was a game called black and white which was one game I was involved with in the early stages of which I still think is the,0.81,42
2,146,1301.371,1302.697,most,0.91,42
2,147,1302.694,1315.147,impressive example of reinforcement learning in a computer game so in that game you know you trained a little pet animal and going game yeah and it's sort of learnt from how you were treating it so if you treated it badly,0.85,42
2,148,1315.063,1325.239,then it became mean and then it would be mean to to your villagers and your and your population the sort of little tribe that you were running but if you were kind to it then it would be kind.,0.9,42
2,149,1325.272,1333.098,And people fascinated by how that works and so as I to be honest with that the way it kind of developed and especially the mapping to Good and Evil,0.8200000000000001,42
2,150,1333.068,1340.786,yeah he made you made you realize made me realize that you can sort of in the way in the choices you make can Define.,0.77,42
2,151,1341.098,1347.204,The where you end up and that means all of us are capable of the good.,0.91,43
2,152,1347.426,1354.028,Evil in all matters in the different choices along the trajectory to those places that you make,0.89,43
2,153,1353.818,1380.009,as fascinating I mean the games can do that philosophical to you and it's rare it seems rare yeah what games I think unique medium because you as the player you're not just passively consuming the the entertainment right you're actually actively involved as an as an agent so I think that's what makes it in some ways can be more visceral than other other mediums like you know films and books so the second so that was you know designing AI in games and then the third use,0.8200000000000001,43
2,154,1379.844,1386.805,I've we've used of AI is in D mind from the beginning which is using games as a testing ground.,0.74,43
2,155,1386.829,1390.847,For proving out AI algorithms and developing AI algorithms.,0.91,43
2,156,1390.889,1401.839,And that was a that was a sort of a core component of our vision at the start of deepmind was that we would use games very heavily as our main testing ground certainly to begin with.,0.9,43
2,157,1401.872,1413.983,Um because it's super efficient to use games and also you know it's very easy to have metrics to see how well your systems are improving and what direction your ideas are going in and whether you're making incremental improvements.,0.89,43
2,158,1414.25,1421.401,And because those games are often rooted in something that humans did for a long time beforehand there's already a strong.,0.81,44
2,159,1421.515,1427.27,Set of rules like it's already a damn good Benchmark yes it's really good for so many reasons because you've got,0.91,44
2,160,1427.187,1435.769,you've got you've got clear measures of how good humans can be at these things and in some cases like go we've been playing it for thousands of years,0.88,44
2,161,1435.586,1448.498,and and often they have scores or at least wind conditions so it's very easy for reward learning systems to get a reward is very easy to specify what that reward is and also at the end it's easy to you know to test.,0.85,44
2,162,1448.513,1453.818,Externally you know how strong is your system by of course playing against,0.91,44
2,163,1453.788,1462.586,you know the world's strongest players at those games so it's so good for so many reasons and it's also very efficient to run potentially millions of simulations,0.91,44
2,164,1462.52,1464.081,in parallel on the cloud.,0.91,44
2,165,1464.132,1473.452,So I think there's a huge reason why we were so successful back in the you know starting out 2010 how come we were able to progress so quickly because,0.91,44
2,166,1473.251,1486.82,we utilize games and you know at the beginning of the mind we also hired some amazing game Engineers who I knew from my previous lives in the games industry and and that helped a bootstrap us very quickly,0.9,44
2,167,1486.755,1493.482,and plus it's somehow super compelling almost at a philosophical level of man versus machine.,0.86,44
2,168,1493.893,1496.813,/ / chess board or a go board,0.6900000000000001,45
2,169,1496.738,1506.463,and especially given that the entire history of AI is defined by people saying is going to be impossible to make a machine that beats a human being in chess.,0.8,45
2,170,1506.821,1512.783,And then once that happened people were certain when I was coming up in AI they go.,0.89,46
2,171,1513.095,1519.922,Is not a game that can be solved because of the combinatorial complexity is just to it's it's you know.,0.77,47
2,172,1519.973,1528.366,No matter how much more is Li you have computers just never going to be able to crack the game of Go and so the then there's something,0.88,47
2,173,1528.309,1536.27,compelling about facing sort of taking on the impossibility of that task from the AI.,0.8200000000000001,47
2,174,1536.96,1543.877,Researcher perspective engineer perspective and then as a human being just observing this whole thing.,0.8200000000000001,48
2,175,1544.648,1547.649,Beliefs about what you thought was impossible.,0.91,49
2,176,1548.321,1555.85,Being broken apart you see it's a humbling to realize we're not as smart as we thought,0.77,50
2,177,1555.793,1566.527,it's humbling to realize that the things we think are impossible now perhaps we'll be done in the the future there's something really powerful about a game,0.8,50
2,178,1566.524,1575.871,AI system beanie human being in a game that drives that message home for like millions billions of people especially in the case of go sure.,0.75,50
2,179,1576.147,1586.043,Full of I think it's a mean it has been a fascinating journey and and especially as I I think about it from I can understand it from both sides both as the AI.,0.75,51
2,180,1586.239,1595.811,You know creators of the AI but also as a games player originally so are you know it was a it was a really interesting hours I mean it was a fantastic.,0.85,51
2,181,1595.916,1607.703,But also somewhat Bittersweet moment the alphago match for me seeing that and and and being obviously heavily heavily involved in that but you know as you say chess has been,0.91,51
2,182,1607.529,1617.497,the I mean Kasparov I think rightly called it the drosophila of intelligence right so it's sort of that I love that phrase and I think he's right because,0.8200000000000001,51
2,183,1617.287,1622.971,chess has been hand in hand with a eye from the beginning of the the whole field.,0.77,51
2,184,1623.031,1632.261,Right so I think every AI practitioner starting with touring and Claude Shannon and all those the sort of forefathers of of the field,0.8,51
2,185,1632.132,1634.296,tried their hand at writing a chess program,0.9,51
2,186,1634.257,1642.713,I've got an original edition of Claude Shannon's first chess program it was 1949 the per the original sort of paper,0.8300000000000001,51
2,187,1642.548,1647.088,and they all did that and ensuring famously wrote a chess program that,0.89,51
2,188,1646.878,1661.456,but all the computers around then we're obviously too slow to run it so you had to write he had to be the computer right so he literally I think spent two or three days running his own program by hand with pencil and paper and playing playing a friend of his with his chest program so.,0.77,51
2,189,1661.822,1664.228,Of course deep blue was a huge moment,0.88,52
2,190,1664.018,1682.485,beating kasbar off but actually when that happened I remember that very vividly of course because it was you know chess and computers and AI all the things I loved and I was at College at the time but I remember going away from that being more impressed by kasparov's mind then I was by deep blue because here was Kasparov,0.85,52
2,191,1682.284,1689.489,with his human mind not only could he play chess more or less to the same level as this brute of a calculation machine but,0.91,52
2,192,1689.351,1698.509,of course Kasparov can do everything else humans can do ride a bike talk many languages do politics all the rest of the amazing things that Kasparov does and so with the same brain,0.8300000000000001,52
2,193,1698.326,1704.297,yeah and and yet deep blue of brilliant as it was at chess it'd been hand coded,0.88,52
2,194,1704.213,1713.705,for chess and actually had distilled the knowledge of Chess Grandmasters into into a cool program but it couldn't do anything else,0.91,52
2,195,1713.657,1722.788,like it can even play a strictly simpler game like tic-tac-toe so something to me was missing from intelligence from that system.,0.85,52
2,196,1722.749,1732.087,That we would regard as intelligence and I think it was this idea of generality and and also learning so allows you to learn try to do that with alphago,0.8300000000000001,53
2,197,1731.985,1738.695,yeah we also go and Alpha 0 mu 0 and then got on all the things that we'll get into some,0.81,53
2,198,1738.557,1743.223,parts of there's just a fascinating trajectory here but let's just stick on chest,0.85,53
2,199,1743.184,1756.645,briefly on The Human Side of Chess you've proposed that from a game design perspective the thing that makes chess compelling as a game is that there's a creative tension between a bishop.,0.85,53
2,200,1756.841,1767.403,And the night can you explain this first I was really interesting to think about what makes game compelling makes it stick across centuries.,0.91,54
2,201,1767.535,1781.069,Yeah I was sort of thinking about this and actually a lot of even amazing chess players don't think about it necessarily from a games designer point of view so it's the business with my game design hat on that I was thinking about this why is chess so compelling and I think a critical,0.8200000000000001,55
2,202,1780.904,1782.023,reason,0.91,55
2,203,1781.822,1791.394,is the dynamic nurse of of the different kind of Chess positions you can have whether they're closed or open and other things comes from the bishop in the night so if you think about how,0.8300000000000001,55
2,204,1791.337,1792.384,different,0.91,55
2,205,1792.328,1802.143,the the capabilities of the bishop and Knight are in terms of the way they move and then somehow chess has evolved to balance those two capabilities more or less equally,0.8300000000000001,55
2,206,1801.933,1820.769,so that both roughly were three points each so you think their Dynamics is always there and then the rest of the rules are kind of trying to stabilize the game well maybe I mean it's sort of I don't eat chicken and egg situation probably both came together but the fact that there is got to this beautiful equilibrium where you can have the bishop or Knight they're so different in power but,0.8200000000000001,55
2,207,1820.604,1824.757,so equal in value across the set of the universe of all positions.,0.9,55
2,208,1824.817,1834.839,Right somehow they've been balanced by Humanity over hundreds of years I think gives gives the game the creative tension that you can swap the bishop and nights,0.89,55
2,209,1834.629,1846.893,Fred a bishop for an eye and you've there more or less the worth the same but now you aim for a different type of position if you have the night you want a closed position if you have the bishop you want an open position so I think that creates a lot of the creative tension in chess,0.77,55
2,210,1846.773,1851.781,so some kind of controlled creative tension from an AI perspective.,0.91,55
2,211,1851.805,1856.832,Do you think AI systems could Venture design games that are optimally compelling to humans.,0.88,55
2,212,1857.468,1866.68,Well that's an interesting question you know sometimes I get asked about Ai and creativity and and this and the way I answered that is relevant to that question which is that I think they're different,0.84,56
2,213,1866.632,1872.928,levels of creativity one could say so I think if we Define creativity as coming up with something original,0.89,56
2,214,1872.871,1879.634,right that's that's useful for a purpose then you know I think the kind of lowest level of creativity is like an interpolation,0.85,56
2,215,1879.56,1891.364,so an averaging of all the examples you see so maybe very basic AI system could say you could have that so you show it millions of pictures of cats and then you say give me an average looking cat right generate me an average-looking cat,0.88,56
2,216,1891.334,1900.123,I would call that interpolation then there's extrapolation which something like alphago showed so alphago played you know millions of games of go against itself.,0.9,56
2,217,1900.157,1906.875,And then it came up with brilliant new ideas like move 37 in game to Britain Motif strategies and go.,0.84,56
2,218,1906.926,1914.914,That no humans had ever thought of even though we've played it for thousands of years and professionally for hundreds of years so that that I call that extrapolation,0.84,56
2,219,1914.731,1923.034,but then that's still there still a level above that which is you know you could call out-of-the-box thinking or true Innovation which is could you invent go.,0.86,56
2,220,1923.176,1933.423,Did you invent chess and not just come up with a brilliant chess move or brilliant go move but can you can you actually invent chess or something as good as chess or go and I think one day.,0.89,57
2,221,1933.483,1938.914,A I could but the what's missing is how would you even specify that task too,0.84,57
2,222,1938.749,1948.754,a program right now and the way I would do it if I was best toiling a human to do a tour games designer to human games designer to do it is I would say something like go I would say.,0.78,57
2,223,1949.156,1955.812,Come up with a game that only takes 5 minutes to learn which go dies because got simple rules but many lifetimes to master.,0.85,58
2,224,1955.926,1964.508,Right or impossible to master in one lifetime because it's so deep and so complex and then it's aesthetically beautiful and also,0.79,58
2,225,1964.334,1972.754,it can be completed in three or four hours of gameplay time which is you know useful for our us you know in a human day and so,0.8200000000000001,58
2,226,1972.634,1981.963,you might specify these side of high-level Concepts like that and then you know with that and maybe a few other things one could imagine that go satisfies,0.86,58
2,227,1981.888,1996.466,those constraints but the problem is is that we're not able to specify abstract Notions like that high-low abstract Notions like that yet to our AI systems and I think there's still something missing there in terms of,0.79,58
2,228,1996.229,2003.812,high-level Concepts or abstractions that they truly understand and you know combined a bond and compositional so,0.76,58
2,229,2003.728,2012.157,for the moment I think AI is capable of doing interpolation extrapolation but not true invention so coming up with rulesets.,0.88,58
2,230,2012.64,2021.933,And optimizing with complicated objectives around those rulesets we can't currently do but you could take a specific rule set,0.8,59
2,231,2021.885,2033.366,and then run kind of self play experiment to see how long just observe how an AI system from scratch learns how long is that journey of learning and maybe.,0.91,59
2,232,2033.399,2044.988,If it satisfies some of those other things you mentioned towards the quick links to learn and so on and you could see a long journey to master for even an AI system that you could say that this is a promising game.,0.75,59
2,233,2045.264,2052.289,But it would be nice to do almost like Alpha codes of programming yeah rules so generating rules that kind of,0.9,60
2,234,2052.205,2065.198,that that automate even that part of the generation of rules so I have thought about systems actually I think the amazing in for a games designer if you could have a system that takes your game,0.84,60
2,235,2065.06,2071.842,plays it tens of millions of times maybe overnight and then self balances the rules better so get tweaks the rules.,0.8,60
2,236,2071.848,2077.45,And maybe the equations and and and the parameters so that the game,0.8300000000000001,60
2,237,2077.375,2088.802,it's more balanced the units in the game or some of the rules could be tweaked so it's a bit of like a giving a base set and then allowing Monte Carlo tree search or something like that to sort of explore it.,0.84,60
2,238,2088.961,2096.94,Right and I think that would be super super powerful tool actually for for balancing Auto balancing a game which usually takes,0.8200000000000001,61
2,239,2096.82,2108.4,thousands of hours from hundreds of games human games testers normally to to balance some other one you know game like Starcraft which is you know blizzard are amazing at balancing their games but it takes them years and years and years.,0.84,61
2,240,2108.451,2115.134,So one could imagine at some point when this this stuff becomes efficient enough to you know you might better do that like overnight,0.88,61
2,241,2115.041,2124.253,do you think a game that is optimal design a Nai system would look very much like planet Earth,0.76,61
2,242,2124.223,2129.852,say p maybe it's only the sort of game I would love to make is is and I've tried.,0.8,61
2,243,2129.966,2144.265,It might make it my games career the game's design career you know my first big game was designing a theme park amusement park then with games like Republic I tried to you know have games where we designed whole cities and and allows you to play in.,0.72,61
2,244,2144.343,2151.071,So and of course people like will right have written games like Sim Earth trying to simulate the whole of Earth pretty tricky.,0.78,61
2,245,2151.077,2154.87,But I say mirth I haven't actually played that one so what is it does it,0.75,61
2,246,2154.804,2162.576,isn't afraid of evolution or yeah it has Evolution and it sort of tries to it sort of treats it as an entire biosphere but from quite high level.,0.8,61
2,247,2162.654,2173.315,So nice to be able to sort of zoom in zoom out and zoom in exactly so obviously it couldn't do that was in the night I think he wrote that in the 90s so it couldn't hit you no it wasn't it wasn't able to do that.,0.85,61
2,248,2173.483,2180.328,But that would be obviously the ultimate Sandbox game of course and that topic do you think we're living in a simulation.,0.75,62
2,249,2180.658,2183.659,Yes well it's okay so I'm going to jump around,0.77,63
2,250,2183.638,2191.572,from the absurdly philosophical To The Shore Technical very very happy too so I think my answer to that question is a little bit complex because.,0.74,63
2,251,2191.776,2197.487,There is simulation Theory which obviously Nick Bostrom I think famously first proposed.,0.85,64
2,252,2197.519,2205.57,And I don't quite believe it in the in that sense so in the in the sense that are we in some sort of computer game,0.86,64
2,253,2205.486,2216.913,or have our descendants somehow recreated Earth in the you know 21st century and and some for some kind of experimental reason I think that but I do think.,0.81,64
2,254,2216.974,2225.07,That we that we might be that the best way to understand physics and the universe is from a computational perspective.,0.8300000000000001,64
2,255,2225.175,2234.405,So understanding it as an information universe and actually information being the most fundamental unit of reality,0.87,64
2,256,2234.177,2251.545,rather than matter or energy so physicists would say you know matter or energy you know equals mc squared these are the things that are the fundamentals of the universe I'd actually say information which of course itself can be can specify energy or matter right matter is actually just you know we're,0.85,64
2,257,2251.317,2262.051,we're just out the way our bodies and will be molecules in our body arranged this information so I think information may be the most fundamental way to describe the universe and therefore,0.76,64
2,258,2261.823,2280.631,you could say we're in some sort of simulation because of that but I do I do I'm not I'm not really subscriber to the idea that you know these are sort of throw away billions of simulations around I think this is actually very critical and possibly unique this simulation particular one yes up but and you just mean.,0.79,64
2,259,2281.097,2284.205,Treating the universe as a computer.,0.9,65
2,260,2284.617,2293.028,That's processing and modifying information is a good way to solve the problems of physics of chemistry or biology,0.71,66
2,261,2292.997,2300.238,in perhaps of humanity and so on yes I think understanding physics in terms of information Theory.,0.77,66
2,262,2300.307,2305.361,Might be the best way to really understand what's going on here,0.87,67
2,263,2305.214,2315.416,from our understanding of universal turing machine from our understanding of a computer do you think there's something outside of the capabilities of a computer,0.81,67
2,264,2315.314,2317.874,that is present in our universe you have a,0.91,67
2,265,2317.727,2325.679,this agreement with Roger pen writes all the nature of Consciousness he did he thinks that Consciousness is more than just a computation,0.7000000000000001,67
2,266,2325.559,2338.894,do you think all of it the whole shebang is it can be can be a company I've had many fascinating debates with sir Roger Penrose and obviously he's famously and I read you know emperor's new mind and and,0.86,67
2,267,2338.675,2346.528,and his books his classical books and they were pretty influential and the you know the 90s and he believes that there's something more.,0.9,67
2,268,2346.507,2355.881,He had something Quantum that is needed to explain Consciousness in the brain I think about what we're doing actually it didn't mind and what my career is being,0.8300000000000001,68
2,269,2355.689,2363.713,we're almost like two rings Champion so we are pushing Turing machines or classical computation to the limits what are the limits of what,0.78,68
2,270,2363.503,2372.472,classical Computing can do now and at the same time I've also studied Neuroscience to see and that's why I did my PhD in was to see,0.9,68
2,271,2372.307,2379.287,also to look at you know is there anything Quantum in the brain from a neuroscience or biological perspective and and so far,0.87,68
2,272,2379.068,2392.412,I think most neuroscientists and most mainstream biologists a neuroscientist would say there's no evidence of any Quantum systems or effects in the brain as far as we can see it's it can be most explained by classical classical theories so.,0.78,68
2,273,2392.833,2410.876,And then so they're sort of the the search from the biology side and then at the same time there's the raising of the water at the bar from what classical Turing machines can do and and and you know including our new AI systems and as you alluded to earlier,0.9,69
2,274,2410.675,2417.025,you know I think Ai and especially in the last decade plus has been a continual story now surprising,0.77,69
2,275,2416.824,2427.666,events and surprising successors knocking over one Theory after another what was thought to be impossible you know from go to protein folding and so on and so I think,0.91,69
2,276,2427.456,2429.142,I would,0.88,69
2,277,2428.986,2441.358,be very hesitant to bet against how far the universal turing machine and classical computation Paradigm can go and and my betting would be,0.91,69
2,278,2441.184,2454.312,that all of certainly what's going on in our brain can probably be mimicked or approximated on a classical machine not you know not requiring something metaphysical or quantum,0.91,69
2,279,2454.219,2464.043,and we'll get there with some of the work with Alpha fold which I think begins a journey of modeling this beautiful and complex world of biology,0.85,69
2,280,2463.996,2473.325,so you think all the magic of the human mind comes from this just a few pounds of mush but biological computational mush,0.9,69
2,281,2473.322,2477.016,that's akin to some of the neural networks.,0.91,69
2,282,2477.4,2488.665,Not directly but in spirit that demand has been working with well look I think it's you say it's a few know of course it's this is the I think that the biggest Miracle of the universe is that,0.81,70
2,283,2488.59,2501.394,it is just a few pounds of mush in our skulls and yet it's also our brains in the most complex objects in the in that we know of in the universe so there's something profoundly beautiful and amazing about our brains and I.,0.71,70
2,284,2501.391,2502.087,Think,0.91,71
2,285,2502.057,2513.403,that it's an incredibly incredible efficient machine and and and it's you know come phenomenon basically and I think that building a,0.87,71
2,286,2513.346,2522.126,one of the reasons I want to build a i and I've always wanted to is I think by building an intelligent artifacts like Ai and then comparing it to the human mind,0.78,71
2,287,2521.916,2544.776,um that will help us unlock the uniqueness and the true secrets of the mind that we've always wondered about since the dawn of History like Consciousness dreaming creativity emotions what all these things right we've wondered about them since since the dawn of humanity and I think one of the reasons and you know I love philosophy and philosophy of mind is,0.76,71
2,288,2544.611,2556.164,we found it difficult as there haven't been the tools for us to really other than introspection to from very clever people in history very clever philosophers to really investigate this scientifically but now,0.79,71
2,289,2556.017,2562.997,suddenly we have a plethora of tools firstly we have all of the Neuroscience tools fmri machine single cell recording all of this stuff but we also have,0.8,71
2,290,2562.849,2570.225,the ability computers in AI to build intelligent systems so I think that.,0.91,71
2,291,2570.222,2587.429,You know I think it is amazing what the human mind does and and and I'm kind of in awe of it really and and I think it's amazing that with our human Minds we're able to build things like computers and and actually even you know thinking investigate about these questions I think that's also Testament,0.78,72
2,292,2587.228,2588.419,to the human mind.,0.89,72
2,293,2588.578,2597.88,Yeah the universe built the human mind that now is building computers that help us understand both the universe and our own human mind right,0.91,73
2,294,2597.869,2601.508,exactly it I mean I think that's one reason I one could say Where We Are.,0.71,73
2,295,2601.631,2613.85,Maybe we're the mechanism by which the universe is going to try and understand itself yeah it's beautiful so let's let's go to the basic building blocks of biology that I think.,0.86,73
2,296,2614.099,2622.547,Is another angle at which you can start to understand the human mind the human body which is quite a fascinating which is from the basic building blocks,0.78,74
2,297,2622.463,2632.449,start to simulate stuck to model how from those building blocks you can construct bigger and bigger more complex systems maybe one day the entirety of the human biology so.,0.8200000000000001,74
2,298,2632.941,2640.371,Here's another problem that thought to be impossible to solve which is protein folding and Alpha folder.,0.9,75
2,299,2640.845,2648.941,Specific Alpha fold to did just that it's solved protein folding I think it's one of the biggest breakthroughs.,0.85,76
2,300,2649.019,2655.558,Certainly in history structural biology but in general and in science.,0.85,76
2,301,2656.104,2660.752,Maybe from a high-level what is it and how does it work,0.8200000000000001,77
2,302,2660.713,2674.733,and then we can ask some fascinating show questions after sure so maybe I took splain it to people not familiar with protein folding is you know I first of all explain proteins which is you know proteins are essential to all life,0.8300000000000001,77
2,303,2674.703,2688.785,every function in your body depends on proteins sometimes they're called the workhorses of biology and if you look into them and I've been obviously as part of alpha fold I've been researching proteins and structural biology for the last few years you know they're amazing,0.88,77
2,304,2688.773,2695.897,little bio nanomachines proteins the incredible if you actually watch the little videos of how they work animations of how they work and,0.81,77
2,305,2695.876,2704.485,proteins are specified by their genetic sequence called the amino acid sequence so you can think of it as their genetic makeup and then in the body.,0.79,77
2,306,2704.527,2709.193,In nature they when they when they fold up into a 3D structure,0.91,78
2,307,2709.191,2716.62,so you can think of it as a string of beads and then they fold up into a ball now the key thing is you want to know what that 3D structure is.,0.91,78
2,308,2716.653,2724.164,Because the structure the 3D structure of a protein is what helps to determine what does it do the function it does in your body,0.85,78
2,309,2723.999,2739.324,and also if you're interested in drug drugs or disease you need to understand that 3D structure because if you want to Target something with a drug compound about to block that something the proteins doing you need to understand where it's going to bind on the surface of the protein,0.91,78
2,310,2739.249,2747.714,it's obviously 15 order to do that you need to understand the 3D structure so the structure is mapped to the function the structure is mapped to the function and the structure is obviously somehow,0.7000000000000001,78
2,311,2747.702,2761.497,specified by the by the amino acid sequence and that's the Innocence the protein folding problem is can you just from the amino acid sequence the one-dimensional string of letters can you immediately computation you predict,0.89,78
2,312,2761.43,2767.348,the 3D structure right and it has been a Grand Challenge in biology for over 50 years.,0.8200000000000001,78
2,313,2767.363,2777.764,So I think it was first articulated by Christian and fincen a Nobel Prize winner 1972 as part of his Nobel prize-winning lecture and he just speculated this should be possible,0.8300000000000001,78
2,314,2777.716,2788.08,to go from the amino acid sequence to the 3D structure be didn't say how so is it I thought you know I've been it's been described to me as equivalent of Fermat's Last Theorem but for biology,0.8,78
2,315,2787.996,2793.743,he should have somebody that very well might win the Nobel Prize in the future but outside of that.,0.85,78
2,316,2794.163,2800.53,You should do more of that kind of thing in the margin just put random things that will take like two hundred years solve.,0.84,79
2,317,2800.546,2817.257,That people offer to your videos should be pastas actually and just don't give any additional actually I think everyone's exactly should be I'll have to remember that for future so yeah so he said off you know with this one throwaway remark just like fermat you know he he said off this whole 50 years,0.9,79
2,318,2817.046,2826.061,field really of computational biology and and they had you know they got stuck they hadn't really got very far with doing this and and,0.84,79
2,319,2826.031,2829.932,until now until Alpha folk came along this is done experimental e.,0.81,79
2,320,2829.956,2844.272,Right very painstakingly so the rule of thumb is and you have to like crystallized the protein which is really difficult some proteins can't be crystallized like membrane proteins and then you have to use very expensive electron microscopes or x-ray crystallography machines,0.84,79
2,321,2844.044,2847.927,really painstaking work to get the 3D structure and visualize the 3D.,0.88,79
2,322,2848.285,2855.291,So the rule of thumb in experimental biology is that takes one PhD student their entire PhD to do one protein,0.87,80
2,323,2855.261,2864.636,and without the full to were able to predict the 3D structure in a matter of seconds and so we were you know over Christmas,0.8,80
2,324,2864.579,2879.174,"we did the whole human proteome or every protein in the human body or 20,000 proteins so the human proteome is like the equivalent of the human genome but on pro teams base and and sort of revolutionized really what structural biologists can do",0.84,80
2,325,2879.171,2888.68,because now they don't have to worry about these painstaking experimental you know should they put all of that effort in or not they can almost just look up the structure of their proteins like a Google search.,0.86,80
2,326,2888.939,2891.903,And so there's a data set on which its.,0.89,81
2,327,2891.927,2903.435,Trained and how to map this amino acid sequence first of all it's incredible that a protein this little chemical computer is able to do that computation itself into some kind of distributed way and do it very quickly.,0.9,81
2,328,2903.657,2907.297,That's a weird thing and they evolve that way because you know in the beginning.,0.8,81
2,329,2907.591,2916.524,I mean that's a great invention just the protein itself I mean and then there's I think probably a history of like they evolved.,0.76,82
2,330,2916.837,2927.372,To have many of these proteins and those proteins figure out how to be computers themselves so in such a way that you can create structures that can interact and complexes with each other in order to form.,0.9,83
2,331,2927.468,2937.158,High-level functions and it's a weird system that they figured it out well for sure I mean we you know maybe we should talk about the origins of life too but proteins themselves I think are magical,0.89,83
2,332,2936.993,2944.864,and incredible as I said little little bio nanomachines and and actually let Levin towel.,0.84,83
2,333,2944.879,2957.485,Who is another scientist a contemporary of a Vinson he coined this Levin towel what became known as Levin towels Paradox which is exactly what you're saying he calculated roughly approached an average protein,0.85,83
2,334,2957.419,2965.884,which is maybe 2000 amino acids and bases long is is can fold in maybe 10 to the power 3 hundred,0.75,83
2,335,2965.818,2972.699,different confirmations so the 10 to the power three hundred different ways that protein could fold up and yet somehow in nature.,0.72,83
2,336,2972.768,2978.28,Physics solves this solves this in a matter of milliseconds so proteins fold up in your body,0.85,83
2,337,2978.169,2988.957,in you know sometimes in fractions of a second so physics is somehow solving that search problem and just to be clear in many of these cases may be correct me if I'm wrong,0.91,83
2,338,2988.891,2990.892,there's often a unique way.,0.91,83
2,339,2991.322,3000.975,For that sequence to form itself yesso among the huge number of possibilities yes it figures out a way how to stably.,0.77,84
2,340,3000.999,3011.31,In some cases there's might be misfunction Miss so on which leads to a lot of the disorders and stuff like that but yes most of the time it's a unique mapping and that unique mappings that obvious no,0.77,84
2,341,3011.189,3019.25,exactly it's just what the problem is exactly so there's a unique mapping usually in a healthy in if it's healthy and as you say in disease.,0.89,84
2,342,3019.895,3031.61,So for example outside MERS 111 conjecture is that it's because of misfolded protein protein that folds in the wrong way amyloid-beta protein so and then because it falls in the wrong way it gets Tangled Up,0.86,85
2,343,3031.589,3035.291,right in your end your neurons so,0.75,85
2,344,3035.108,3051.892,it's super important to understand both healthy functioning and and also disease is to understand you know what these things are doing and how they're structuring of course the next step is sometimes proteins change shape when they interact with something so they're not just static necessarily in in biology.,0.91,85
2,345,3052.078,3060.669,Maybe you can give some interesting sort of beautiful things to you about these early days of alpha fold of.,0.9,85
2,346,3060.828,3065.791,Of solving this problem because unlike games this is real.,0.9,85
2,347,3065.995,3080.546,Physical systems that are less amenable to self play type of mechanisms should the size of data set is smaller than you might otherwise likes have to be very clever about certain things is there something you could speak to,0.79,86
2,348,3080.534,3094.346,what was very hard to solve and what are some beautiful aspects about the the solution yeah I always take a four-fold is the most complex and also probably most meaningful system we've built so far so it's been an amazing time actually in the last,0.91,86
2,349,3094.218,3103.97,you know 23 years to see that come through because as we talked about earlier you know games is what we started on building things like alphago and Alpha 0,0.84,86
2,350,3103.769,3122.361,but really the ultimate goal was to not just to crack games it was just to build use them to bootstrap General Learning Systems we could then apply to real-world challenges specifically my passion is scientific challenges like protein folding and then Alpha fold of course is our first big proof point of that and so,0.8300000000000001,86
2,351,3122.16,3124.693,in terms of the data,0.75,86
2,352,3124.528,3136.027,and the amount of innovations that had to go into it we you know it was like more than 30 different component algorithms needed to be put together to crack the protein folding I think some of the big Innovations were the,0.8300000000000001,86
2,353,3135.826,3137.431,kind of,0.91,86
2,354,3137.266,3150.944,building in some hard-coded constraints around physics and evolutionary biology to constrain sort of things like the bond angles in the in the in the protein and things like that.,0.91,86
2,355,3151.256,3158.01,Along but not to impact the Learning System so still allowing the system to be able to learn the physics,0.75,87
2,356,3157.782,3173.918,"itself from the examples that we had and the examples as you say there are only about 150 thousand proteins even after 40 Years of experimental biology only around 150,000 proteins have been the structures of being found out about so that was our training set which is",0.85,87
2,357,3173.726,3181.974,much less than normally we would like to use but using various tricks things like self distillation so actually using,0.91,87
2,358,3181.791,3197.323,Alpha folds predictions some of the best predictions that it thought was highly confident in we put them back into the training set right to make the training set bigger that was critical to to Alpha fold working so there was actually a huge number of different.,0.87,87
2,359,3197.356,3201.743,Innovations like that that were required to to ultimately crack the problem.,0.91,87
2,360,3201.93,3210.386,A four-fold one What It produced was disc 2 G so a kind of Matrix of the pairwise distances between,0.89,88
2,361,3210.203,3217.263,all of the molecules in the in the in the protein and then there had to be a separate optimisation process too,0.88,88
2,362,3217.026,3235.088,create the 3D structure and what we did for Alpha V uu is make it truly end-to-end so we went straight from the amino acid sequence of bases to the 3D structure directly without going through this intermediate step and in machine learning what we've always found is that,0.86,88
2,363,3234.914,3240.408,the more end-to-end you can make it the better the system and this probably because,0.88,88
2,364,3240.225,3258.125,we you know the in the end the system is better at learning what the constraints are then then then we are as the human designers of specifying it so anytime you can let it flow end to end and actually just generate what it is you're really looking for in this case the 3D structure you're better off than having this intermediate step which you then have to handcraft,0.81,88
2,365,3257.924,3266.488,the next step for so it's better to let the gradients in the learning flow all the way through the system from the endpoint the end output you want to the.,0.8300000000000001,88
2,366,3266.701,3272.294,So that's a good way to start a new problem handcraft a bunch of stuff add a bunch of Manuel constraints.,0.79,88
2,367,3272.498,3278.767,With a small and 10 learning piece or a small learning piece and grow that learning piece until it consumes as a whole,0.78,89
2,368,3278.701,3282.935,that's right and so you can also see you know this is a bit of a method we've,0.91,89
2,369,3282.806,3293.882,over doing many sort of successful outfits we call them out 4X projects right is and the easiest way to see that is the evolution of alpha go to Alpha 0 so Alpha go,0.78,89
2,370,3293.699,3297.816,was a learning system but it was specifically trained to only play Go.,0.8300000000000001,89
2,371,3297.858,3304.72,Right so and what we wanted to do and with the first version of alphago is just get to world champion performance no matter how we did it.,0.76,89
2,372,3304.852,3311.112,Right and then and then of course alphago zero we remove the need to use human games as a starting point.,0.86,90
2,373,3311.127,3316.099,Right so it could just play against itself from random starting point from the beginning.,0.87,90
2,374,3316.15,3322.869,So that removes the need for human knowledge about go and then finally Alpha 0 then generalized it so there any,0.85,90
2,375,3322.83,3327.28,things we had in there the system including things like symmetry of the go board,0.9,90
2,376,3327.052,3343.691,we removed so the alpha 0 could play from scratch any two player game and then mu 0 which is the final that our latest version of that set of things was then extending it so that you didn't even have to give it the rules of the game it would learn that for itself so it could also deal with computer games as well as board games,0.79,90
2,377,3343.58,3353.009,so that line of alpha golf goes 0 Alpha 0 mu 0 that's the full trajectory of what you can take from imitation learning.,0.8,90
2,378,3353.032,3362.245,To full self supervised learning yeah exactly and learning learning the entire structure of the environment you're put in,0.73,90
2,379,3362.161,3374.29,from scratch right and and and and bootstrapping it through self play yourself but the thing is it would have been impossible I think all very hard for us to build Alpha 0 or mu 0 first out of the box.,0.88,90
2,380,3374.449,3381.33,Even psychologically because you have to believe in yourself for a very long time you're constantly dealing with doubt because a lot of,0.77,91
2,381,3381.255,3393.231,people say that it's impossible exactly so it was hard enough just to do go as you were saying everyone thought that was impossible or at least a decade away from when we when we were did it in back in 2015 24th 2016,0.75,91
2,382,3393.156,3402.215,and and so yes it would have been psychologically probably very difficult as well as the fact that of course we learn a lot by building Alpha go first,0.9,91
2,383,3402.194,3410.65,right so it's I think this is why I call AI and engineering science it's one of the most fascinating science disciplines but it's also an engineering science in the sense that,0.81,91
2,384,3410.53,3424.531,unlike Natural Sciences the phenomenon you're studying doesn't exist out in nature you have to build it first so you have to build the artifact first and then you can study how and pull it apart and how it works this is tough too.,0.77,91
2,385,3424.637,3440.547,Ask you this question because you probably will say it's everything but let's let's try let's try to think through this because you're in a very interesting position where deepmind is the place of some of the most brilliant ideas in the history of AI but it's also a place of brilliant engineering,0.81,91
2,386,3440.345,3447.127,so how much of solving intelligence this big goal for deepmind how much of it is.,0.8300000000000001,91
2,387,3447.196,3455.571,Science how much is engineering so how much is the algorithms how much is the data how much is the hard work compute infrastructure.,0.89,91
2,388,3455.713,3459.064,How much is it the software computer infrastructure,0.91,92
2,389,3458.998,3471.055,um what else is there how much is the human infrastructure and like just the humans interacting certain kinds of ways you can all as base of all those ideas and how much does maybe like philosophy how much what's the key,0.86,92
2,390,3471.043,3472.469,if,0.91,92
2,391,3472.871,3482.389,If you were to sort of look back like if we go forward 200 years looking back what was the key thing that solved intelligence,0.85,93
2,392,3482.188,3495.298,is that ideas are the engineers a combination I first of all of course it's a combination of all those things but the ratios of them changed over to overtime so so even in the last 12 years we started deep mine in 2010,0.77,93
2,393,3495.296,3500.898,which is hard to imagine now because 2010 Sony 12 short years ago but nobody was talking about AI.,0.84,93
2,394,3500.949,3507.037,Yeah I don't remember back to your MIT days ago you no one was talking about it I did a postdoc at MIT back around then,0.81,93
2,395,3506.908,3513.069,and it was sort of thought of as well look we know AI doesn't work we tried this hard in the 90s at places like MIT,0.87,93
2,396,3512.895,3523.17,mostly losing using logic systems and old-fashioned sort of good old-fashioned AI we would call it now people like Minsky and and Patrick Winston and you know all these characters right and,0.86,93
2,397,3523.041,3529.453,he's the debate a few of them and they used to think I was mad thinking about that some new Advanced could be done with learning systems.,0.9,93
2,398,3529.468,3537.78,I was actually pleased to hear that because at least you know you're on a unique track at that point right even if every all of your you know Professor the tells you you're mad sure,0.88,93
2,399,3537.723,3542.857,and of course in Industry you can we couldn't get you know difficult to get two cents together,0.88,93
2,400,3542.836,3551.112,and which is hard to imagine now as well given this the biggest sort of buzzword in VCS and fundraising ZZ and all these kind of things today so.,0.84,93
2,401,3551.541,3557.189,Back in 2010 it was very difficult and what we the reason we started then and Shane and I used to discuss,0.87,94
2,402,3557.105,3564.652,um what was the sort of founding tenants of deepmind and it was various things one was algorithmic advances,0.74,94
2,403,3564.532,3573.996,so deep learning you know Geoff Hinton and courage just had just sort of invented that in Academia but no one in Industry knew about it we love reinforcement learning we thought that could be scaled up.,0.86,94
2,404,3574.128,3582.539,But also understanding about the human brain had Advanced quite a lot in the decade prior with fmri machines and other things so we could get some.,0.91,95
2,405,3582.653,3590.777,Good hints about architectures and algorithms and and and sort of representations may be that the brain uses so as at a systems level,0.84,95
2,406,3590.773,3595.692,no add a implementation level and then the other big things were.,0.73,95
2,407,3595.725,3604.388,And gpus right so we could see a compute was going to be really useful and I got to a place where it become commoditized mostly through the games industry.,0.79,95
2,408,3604.403,3613.498,And and that could be taken advantage of and then the final thing was also mathematical and theoretical definitions of intelligence so things like aixi a like see,0.91,95
2,409,3613.459,3620.862,which Shane worked on with his supervisor markets hotel which is sort of theoretical proof really of universal intelligence.,0.76,95
2,410,3620.868,3629.027,Which is actually reinforcement learning system in the limit I mean it seems infinite Computing infinite memory in the way through you know like a turing machine Prius,0.86,95
2,411,3628.79,3631.944,but I was also waiting to see something like that too,0.88,95
2,412,3631.707,3640.496,you know like Turing machines and and computation Theory they're people like cheering and Shannon came up with underpins modern computer science,0.81,95
2,413,3640.268,3651.047,you know I was waiting for a theory like that to sort of underpin a GI research so when I you know met Shane and so he was working on something like that you know that to me was a sort of final piece of the jigsaw so.,0.78,95
2,414,3651.278,3653.477,In the early days I would say that,0.86,96
2,415,3653.276,3670.59,ideas where the most important you know and for us it was deep reinforcement learning scaling up deep learning of course we've seen Transformers so huge leaps I would say like 3 or 4 from 4 if you think from 2010 till now huge Evolution seems like alphago,0.87,96
2,416,3670.479,3674.263,and and and maybe there's a few more still needed.,0.91,96
2,417,3674.62,3681.879,As we get closer to a i AGI I think it will engineering becomes more and more important and data,0.8,97
2,418,3681.858,3690.828,because scale and of course the recent you know results are gp3 in all the big language models and large models including our ones has shown that scale,0.85,97
2,419,3690.654,3699.182,is a is a large models are clearly going to be a necessary but perhaps not sufficient part of an AGI solution and,0.91,97
2,420,3698.99,3707.572,throughout that like you said and I'd like to give you a big thank-you you're one of the Pioneers in this is sticking by ideas like,0.79,97
2,421,3707.47,3712.289,reinforcement learning that this can actually work given oxygen.,0.9,97
2,422,3712.466,3720.571,Limited success in the past and also which we still don't know but proudly.,0.91,97
2,423,3720.658,3729.546,Having the best researchers in the world and talking about solving intelligence so talking about whatever you call it a GI or something like this.,0.91,97
2,424,3729.588,3741.402,That's speaking of MIT that's that's just something not you wouldn't bring up no not not maybe you did in like 40 50 years ago but that was.,0.71,97
2,425,3741.76,3750.09,Um a I was a place where you do tinkering very small-scale not very ambitious projects and,0.81,98
2,426,3749.988,3759.407,maybe the biggest ambitious projects were in the space of Robotics and doing like the DARPA challenge so the task of solving intelligence and believing you can.,0.89,98
2,427,3759.593,3768.652,That's really really powerful so in order for engineering to do its work to have great engineers build great systems you have to have that belief,0.87,98
2,428,3768.55,3782.011,the threads throughout the whole thing that you can actually solve some of these impossible challenges yeah that's right and and back in 2010 you know our mission statement and still is today you know it was used to be solving Step 1 solve intelligence.,0.86,98
2,429,3782.045,3786.648,Up to use it to solve everything else yes so if you can imagine pitching that to a VC in 2010.,0.8200000000000001,98
2,430,3786.717,3792.355,You know the kind of looks we got we managed to you know find a few key people to backups but,0.8,98
2,431,3792.226,3806.039,it was it was Ricky and I got to the point where we wouldn't mention it to any of our professors because they would just I roll and think we you know committed career suicide and and and and you know so it was there's a lot of things that we had to do.,0.87,98
2,432,3806.288,3812.934,We always believed it and once reason you know by the way one reason we I believe I've always believed in reinforcement learning is that.,0.8300000000000001,99
2,433,3813.291,3816.328,If you look at Neuroscience that is the way,0.8,100
2,434,3816.154,3829.102,that the you know primate brain learns one of the main mechanisms is the dopamine system Implement some form of TD learning has very famous result in the late 90s where they saw this in monkeys and and as you know,0.84,100
2,435,3829.01,3832.685,probably game prediction error so we you know again in the limit,0.8,100
2,436,3832.664,3840.49,this is this is what I think you can use Neuroscience for is is you know any at mathematics you when you're when you're doing something as ambitious as trying to solve intelligence,0.8,100
2,437,3840.425,3848.89,and you're you know it's blue sky research no one knows how to do it you you you need to use any evidence or any source of information you can to help,0.84,100
2,438,3848.887,3860.349,guide you in the right direction or give you confidence you're going in the right direction so that was one reason we push so hard on that and I think it's just going back to your earlier question about organization the other big thing,0.89,100
2,439,3860.121,3870.765,that I think we innovated with it deepmind to encourage invention and and and Innovation was the multidisciplinary organization we built and we still have today so,0.73,100
2,440,3870.555,3879.875,deepmind originally was a Confluence of the of the most cutting-edge knowledge in Neuroscience with machine learning engineering and Mathematics right and gaming.,0.88,100
2,441,3879.962,3882.711,And then since then we built that out even further,0.91,101
2,442,3882.627,3890.237,so we have philosophers here and and bioethicists but also other types of scientists physicists and so on and that's what,0.91,101
2,443,3890.081,3895.935,brings together I tried to build a sort of new type of bell Labs but in his Golden Era,0.81,101
2,444,3895.743,3914.831,right and and a new expression of that to try and Foster this incredible sort of innovation machine so talking about the humans in the machine we're the Mind itself is a learning machine with a lot of amazing human Minds in it coming together to try and build these learning systems,0.84,101
2,445,3914.711,3924.248,if we return to the big ambitious dream of alpha fold that maybe the early steps on a very long journey,0.8300000000000001,101
2,446,3924.173,3927.011,in in biology.,0.78,101
2,447,3928.439,3937.067,Do you think the same kind of approach can use to predict the structure and function of more complex biological systems so multi protein interaction.,0.89,102
2,448,3937.289,3938.615,And then,0.91,102
2,449,3938.549,3950.372,I mean you can go up from there yeah just simulating bigger and bigger systems that eventually simulate something like the human brain or the human body just the big mush the massive the Beautiful.,0.89,102
2,450,3950.549,3957.367,Resilient mess of biology do you see that as a long-term Vision I do and I think,0.87,103
2,451,3957.301,3975.317,you know if you think about what are the things top things I wanted to apply a I too once we had powerful enough systems biology and curing diseases and understanding biology was right up there you know top of my list that's one of the reasons I personally pushed that myself and with Alpha fold but I think Alpha fold,0.89,103
2,452,3975.161,3978.297,amazing as it is is just the beginning.,0.91,103
2,453,3978.258,3986.192,And and and I hope it's an Evidence of what could be done with computational methods so,0.9,104
2,454,3985.955,4001.181,you know Alpha fold solve this this huge problem of the structure of proteins but biology is dynamic so really what I imagined from here and we're working on all these things now is protein-protein interaction protein ligand binding so reacting with molecules,0.7000000000000001,104
2,455,4000.953,4005.988,then you want to put get build-up to Pathways and then pinch eventually a virtual cell,0.84,104
2,456,4005.814,4022.903,that's my dream maybe in the next 10 years and I've been talking actually to a lot of biologists friends of mine Paul nurse who runs the Crick Institute amazing biologist Nobel prize-winning biologist we've been discussing for 20 years now virtual cells could you build a virtual simulation of a cell and if you could that would be incredible for,0.85,104
2,457,4022.684,4047.237,Balaji and dizzy Discovery because you could do loads of experiments on the virtual cell and then only at the last stage validate it in the wet lab so you could you know that in terms of the search space of discovering new drugs you know text 10 years roughly to go from to go from you know identifying a Target to having a drug candidate maybe that could be shortened to you know by an order of magnitude with if you could do most of that,0.8200000000000001,104
2,458,4047.062,4051.216,that work in silico so in order to get to Virtual cell.,0.8300000000000001,104
2,459,4051.581,4064.998,We have to build up understanding of different parts of biology in the interactions and and so we you know we every few years we talked about this with what I talked about this with poor and then finally last year after Alpha fault I said Now's the Time,0.8,105
2,460,4064.986,4079.789,we can finally go for it and Alpha folds the first proof point that this might be possible and he's very exciting we have some collaborations with his with his lab and they're just across the road actually from our services you know Wonderful being here in Kings Cross with the Crick Institute across the road and.,0.88,105
2,461,4079.84,4080.761,And I think,0.84,105
2,462,4080.731,4091.843,the next steps you know I think there's going to be some amazing advances in biology built on top of things like Alpha fold we're already seeing that with the community doing that after we've open sourced and released it,0.91,105
2,463,4091.813,4098.225,and you know I often say that I think if you think of mathematics,0.86,105
2,464,4098.141,4107.56,is the perfect description language for physics I think AI might be end up being the perfect description language for biology because biology so messy,0.8,105
2,465,4107.531,4117.283,it's so emergent so Dynamic and complex I think I find it very hard to believe we'll ever get to something as elegant as Newton's Laws of motions to describe a cell.,0.9,105
2,466,4117.307,4125.295,Right it's just too complicated so I think AI is the right tool for this you have to you have to start at the basic building blocks,0.72,105
2,467,4125.247,4135.027,and use AI to run the simulation for all those building blocks so have a very strong way to do prediction of what given these building blocks what kind of biologic how the.,0.8,105
2,468,4135.167,4139.221,The function and the evolution of that biological system.,0.91,105
2,469,4139.399,4151.087,It's almost like a cellular automata you have to run you can't analyze it from a high level you have to take the basic ingredients figure out the rules yeah and let it run but in this case the rules are very difficult to figure out yes,0.89,106
2,470,4150.904,4159.396,exact learn them that's exactly it so it's the Balaji too complicated to figure out the rules it's it's it to emergent to Dynamic,0.8300000000000001,106
2,471,4159.366,4172.269,say a competitor physics system like the motion of a planet right and and so you have to learn the rules and that's exactly the type of systems that we're building so you you must leave open sores Alpha fold and even the data involved.,0.77,106
2,472,4172.41,4174.358,To me personally also.,0.91,106
2,473,4175.075,4184.611,Really happy in a big thank you for open-sourcing with Yoko the physics simulation engine that's that's often used for robotics research and so on.,0.8,107
2,474,4184.905,4190.778,So I think that's a pretty gangster move so what's the what's I mean this.,0.91,108
2,475,4191.0,4197.052,Very few companies or people do that kind of thing what's the philosophy behind that,0.8300000000000001,109
2,476,4197.031,4205.262,you know it's a case-by-case basis and in both those cases we felt that was the maximum benefit to humanity to do that and and the scientific community.,0.9,109
2,477,4205.305,4216.101,In one case the robotics physics Community with my joke oh so we're just that we purchased difference for wipe to OBS we published it for the express principle to open source set so,0.77,109
2,478,4215.981,4224.878,so you know I hope people appreciate that is great to hear that you do and then the second thing was and mostly we did it because the person building it is,0.78,109
2,479,4224.785,4237.95,would not it was not able to cope with supporting it anymore because it was it got too big for him is amazing Professor who built it in the first place so we helped him out with that and then without fourfold even bigger I would say and I think in that case,0.79,109
2,480,4237.802,4242.397,we decided that there were so many Downstream applications of alpha fold.,0.89,109
2,481,4242.457,4248.707,Um that we couldn't possibly even imagine what they all were so the best way to accelerate,0.91,109
2,482,4248.569,4259.294,drug Discovery and also fundamental research would be to give all that data away and and and the and the and the system itself,0.88,109
2,483,4259.111,4267.279,you know it's been so gratifying to see what people have done that within just one year which is a short amount of time in science and it's been used by,0.91,109
2,484,4267.222,4279.999,"over 500,000 researchers have used it we think that's almost every bar largest in the world think there's roughly 500,000 biologists in the world professional biologist have used it to to look at there and proteins of Interest.",0.8200000000000001,109
2,485,4280.311,4295.006,We see an amazing fundamental research done so a couple of weeks ago front cover of there was a whole special issue of science with including the front cover which had the nuclear pore complex on it which is one of the biggest proteins in the body the nuclear pore complex has a protein that governs,0.84,110
2,486,4294.805,4301.236,all the nutrients going in and out of your cell nucleus so they're like little Holt gateways that open and close to,0.85,110
2,487,4301.016,4311.03,things go in and out of your cell nucleus so they're really important but they're huge because they're massive do not ring shape things and they've been looking to try and figure out that structure for decades,0.86,110
2,488,4310.82,4317.79,and they have lots of you know experimental data but it's too low resolution there's bits missing and they were able to like a giant Lego,0.86,110
2,489,4317.707,4325.83,jigsaw puzzle use Alpha for predictions plus experimental data and combined those two independent sources information,0.78,110
2,490,4325.646,4345.58,actually four different groups around the world are able to put it together the second more or less simultaneously using Alpha 4 predictions so that's been amazing to see and pretty much every farmer company every Drug Company executive I've spoken to have said that their teams are using Alpha fold to accelerate whatever drugs they're they're trying to discover so I think the knock-on effect.,0.81,110
2,491,4345.748,4347.363,Has been enormous,0.8200000000000001,110
2,492,4347.315,4360.029,in terms of the impact that Alpha folders made and it's probably bringing and it's creating biologists bringing more people into the field but both on the excitement and both on the technical skills involved.,0.86,110
2,493,4360.395,4361.299,Enough.,0.8200000000000001,111
2,494,4361.475,4371.183,It's almost like a gateway drug to biology yes it is you follow computational people involved to hopefully and I think for us you know the next stage,0.84,111
2,495,4371.045,4383.228,as I said you know future we have to have other considerations to we're building on top of alpha fold and these other ideas I discussed with you about protein-protein interactions and and genomics and other things and not everything will be open source some of it will,0.89,111
2,496,4383.009,4391.366,well do commercially because I will be the best way to actually get the most resources in Impact behind it in other ways other some other projects will do nonprofit Style,0.8200000000000001,111
2,497,4391.156,4399.468,and also we have to consider for future things as well safety and ethics as well like but you know synthetic biology there are you know there is dual use.,0.91,111
2,498,4399.492,4408.002,And we have to think about that as well with Alpha fold we you know we consulted with 30 different bioethicists and and other people expert in this field to make sure it was safe before,0.8300000000000001,111
2,499,4407.783,4418.04,we released it so they'll be other considerations in future but for right now you know I think Alpha fold is a kind of a gift from us to to the scientific community so I'm pretty sure,0.78,111
2,500,4417.974,4421.1,that something like Alpha fold,0.8200000000000001,111
2,501,4421.007,4435.468,would be part of Nobel prizes in the future but us humans of course are horrible credit assignment so will of course give it to the humans do you think there will be a day when AI system.,0.85,111
2,502,4436.419,4445.848,Can't be denied that it learned that Nobel Prize do you think we will see that in 21st century it depends what type of AI is we end up building.,0.87,112
2,503,4445.872,4453.671,Whether they're you know goal-seeking agents who specifies the goals who comes up with the hypotheses.,0.87,112
2,504,4453.686,4465.545,Who you know who determines which problems to tackle right so I think it's about announcement it's results announced the results exactly as part of it so I think right now of course it's it's it's,0.75,112
2,505,4465.335,4472.378,amazing human Ingenuity that's behind the systems and then the system in my opinion is just at all you know be a bit like saying.,0.79,112
2,506,4472.383,4485.8,With Galileo and his telescope you know the Ingenuity the the credit should go to the telescope I mean it's clearly Galileo building the tool which he then uses so I still see that in the same way today even though these tools learn for themselves.,0.8200000000000001,112
2,507,4485.833,4492.641,Um they are I think of I think of things like Alpha fold and the things we're building as the Ultimate Tools for science,0.77,112
2,508,4492.584,4499.681,and for acquiring new knowledge to help us as scientists acquire new knowledge I think one day there will come a point where.,0.87,112
2,509,4500.345,4510.295,An AI system may solve will come up with something like general relativity off its own bat not just by averaging everything on the internet or averaging everything on PubMed.,0.8200000000000001,113
2,510,4511.066,4519.316,That would be interesting to see what that would come up with so that to me is a bit like our earlier debate about creativity you know inventing go,0.91,114
2,511,4519.114,4522.34,rather than just coming up with a good go move,0.89,114
2,512,4522.112,4531.46,and so I think solving I think too you know if we wanted to give it the credit of like a noble type of thing then it would need to invent go,0.91,114
2,513,4531.24,4542.172,and sort of invent that new conjecture out of the blue rather than being specified by the the human scientists or the human Creator so I think right now that's it's definitely just at all,0.86,114
2,514,4542.07,4551.49,although it is interesting how far you get by averaging everything on the internet like you said because you know a lot of people do see science as you're always standing on the shoulders of giants,0.81,114
2,515,4551.468,4559.07,and the question is how much are you really reaching up above the shoulders of giants maybe it's just,0.91,114
2,516,4559.012,4563.201,assimilating different kinds of results of the past.,0.76,114
2,517,4563.45,4577.875,With ultimately this New Perspective that gives you this breakthrough idea but that idea may not be novel in the way that we can be already discovered in the internet maybe the Nobel prizes of the next hundred years already all there on the internet.,0.89,115
2,518,4577.908,4586.013,"To be discovered they could be they could be I mean I think
this is one of the big Mysteries I think is that.",0.88,115
2,519,4586.091,4595.96,I first of all I believe a lot of the big new breakthroughs that are going to come in the next few decades and even in the last decade are going to come at the intersection between different subject areas.,0.84,115
2,520,4596.056,4602.028,Where they'll be some new connection that's found between what seemingly were disparate areas,0.88,115
2,521,4602.025,4611.732,and one can even think of deepmind is as I said earlier as a sort of interdisciplinary between Neuroscience ideas and AI engineering ideas originally and so.,0.86,115
2,522,4611.837,4621.707,So I think there's that and then one of the things we can't imagine today is and the one of the reasons I think people we were so surprised by how well large models worked is that actually.,0.78,115
2,523,4621.983,4627.568,It's very hard for our human Minds our limited human Minds to understand what it would be like to read the whole internet,0.78,116
2,524,4627.511,4634.419,but I think we can do a thought experiment and I used to do this of like well what if I read the whole of Wikipedia what would I know,0.88,116
2,525,4634.334,4645.599,and I think our minds can just about comprehend maybe what that would be like but the whole internet is beyond comprehension so I think we just don't understand what it would be like to have about a hold all of that in mind,0.86,116
2,526,4645.371,4655.358,potentially right and then active at once and then maybe what are the connections that are available there so I think no doubt there are huge things to be discovered just like that,0.89,116
2,527,4655.139,4665.026,but I do think there is this other type of creativity of true spark of new knowledge new idea never thought before about can't be average from things that are known,0.89,116
2,528,4664.798,4671.462,that really of course everything comes you know nobody creates in a vacuum so there must be a clue somewhere,0.87,116
2,529,4671.243,4679.808,that just a unique way of putting those things together I think some of the greatest scientists in history have displayed that I would say although it's very hard to know,0.81,116
2,530,4679.796,4689.179,going back to their time what was exactly known when they came up with us whether you're making a really think because just a thought experiment,0.8300000000000001,116
2,531,4689.095,4692.546,of deeply knowing 100 Wikipedia pages.,0.84,116
2,532,4693.191,4702.647,I don't think I can I've been really impressed by Wikipedia for for technical topics yeah so if you know 100 Pages or 1000 pages.,0.89,117
2,533,4702.886,4706.733,I don't think you can Vision truly comprehend what's.,0.77,117
2,534,4706.811,4721.759,What kind of intelligence that is yeah it's a pretty powerful tool if you know how to use that in integrate that information correctly yes I think go really far yeah you can probably construct thought experiments based on that like simulate different ideas,0.72,117
2,535,4721.62,4728.15,who solve this is true let me run this thought experiment that maybe this is true it's not really invention it's like just.,0.72,117
2,536,4728.3,4738.241,Taking literally the knowledge and using it to construct the very basic simulation of the world we are some argue it's romantic and part but Einstein would do the same kind of things.,0.8300000000000001,117
2,537,4738.266,4747.595,What's a thought experiment yeah you one could imagine doing that systematically across millions of Wikipedia Pages plus PubMed all these things I think there are.,0.72,117
2,538,4747.853,4760.801,Many many things to be discovered like that they're hugely useful you know you could imagine and I want us to do some other things in Material Science like room-temperature superconductors is something on my list one day that I'd like to like it you know have an AI system to help build.,0.8,118
2,539,4760.825,4762.557,Better optimized batteries,0.76,118
2,540,4762.481,4772.711,all of these sort of mechanical things mr. I think a systematic sort of search could be guided by model could be could be extremely powerful,0.76,118
2,541,4772.654,4781.74,So speaking of which you have a paper on nuclear fusion magnetic control of Tokamak plasmas to deep reinforcement learning so you are.,0.88,118
2,542,4782.323,4789.456,You're seeking to solve nuclear fusion with D Bar L so it's doing control of high-temperature plasmas can you explain this work,0.79,119
2,543,4789.327,4804.102,and can a I eventually solve nuclear fusion it's been very fun last year or two very productive because we've been taking off a lot of my dream projects if you like the things that I've collected over the years of areas of science that I would like,0.88,119
2,544,4803.964,4811.502,I think could be very transformative if we helped accelerate and a really interesting problems scientific challenges in of themselves.,0.89,119
2,545,4811.535,4815.805,This is energy so energy yes exactly so energy and climate,0.6900000000000001,119
2,546,4815.784,4828.39,so we talked about disease and biology is being one of the biggest places I think I can out with I think energy and climate is another one so maybe they would be my top two and fusion is one one area I think I can help with,0.76,119
2,547,4828.324,4831.289,now Fusion has many challenges,0.77,119
2,548,4831.16,4845.17,mostly physics and Material Science and Engineering challenges as well to build these massive Fusion reactors and contain the plasma and what we try to do and whenever we go into a new field it has to apply our systems is we look for we talked to domain experts,0.8200000000000001,119
2,549,4845.024,4848.33,we try and find the best people in the world to collaborate with.,0.91,119
2,550,4848.715,4855.433,In this case infusion we collaborated with epfl in Switzerland Swiss Technical Institute who are amazing they have a test reactor.,0.74,120
2,551,4855.448,4865.12,They were they were willing to let us use which you know I double checked with the team we were going to use carefully and safely I was impressed they managed to persuade them to let us use it,0.91,120
2,552,4864.909,4877.704,and and it's an amazing test reactor they have there and they try all sorts of pretty crazy experiments on it and the that what we tend to look at is if we go into a new domain like Fusion,0.91,120
2,553,4877.53,4879.577,what are all the bottleneck problems.,0.89,120
2,554,4879.583,4889.228,It's like thinking from first principles you know what all the Boston at problems that are still stopping Fusion working today and then we look at we you know we get a fusion expert to tell us and then we look at those,0.8,121
2,555,4888.999,4894.008,bottlenecks and we look at the ones which ones are amenable to our AI methods today.,0.91,121
2,556,4893.923,4910.671,Yes light and and and that and would be interesting from a research perspective from our point of view from an AI point of view and that would address one of their bottlenecks and in this case plasma control was perfect so you know the plasma it's a million degrees Celsius something like that hotter than the sun,0.79,122
2,557,4910.443,4928.63,and there's obviously no material that can contain it so they have to be containing these magnetic very powerful most superconducting magnetic fields but the problem is plasma is pretty unstable as you imagine you're kind of holding a mini some mini star in a reactor so you know you kind of want to predict ahead of time,0.86,122
2,558,4928.385,4932.34,what the plasma is going to do so you can maneuver the magnetic field,0.91,122
2,559,4932.102,4950.353,within a few milliseconds you know to basically contain what it's going to do next so it seems like a perfect problem if you think of it for like a reinforcement learning prediction problem so you know you got controller you've got to move the magnetic field and cut an on till we came along you know they were they were doing with with traditional operational,0.86,122
2,560,4950.107,4959.814,research type of controllers which I kind of handcrafted and the problem is of course they can't react in the moment to something the plasma is doing now they have to be hard-coded and again,0.77,122
2,561,4959.65,4969.653,knowing that that's normally our go-to solution is we would like to learn that instead and they also had a simulator of these plasma so there are lots of criteria that matched what we like to do too,0.87,122
2,562,4969.426,4970.149,to use.,0.91,122
2,563,4970.632,4981.933,So can a I eventually solve nuclear fusion well so we would this problem and we published it in a nature paper last year we held the fusion that we held the plasma in a specific shape.,0.77,123
2,564,4982.038,4991.277,It's actually it's almost like carving the password into different shapes and control and hold it there for the record amount of time so so that's one of the problems.,0.91,123
2,565,4991.292,5004.96,Of fusion sort of solved so the have a controller that's able to no matter the shape contain it contains yeah contain it and hold it in structure and there's different shapes that are better for for the energy Productions called droplets and.,0.89,123
2,566,5004.993,5007.797,And and so on so so that was huge,0.89,123
2,567,5007.739,5015.34,and now we're looking we're talking to lots of fusion startups to see what's the next Pond we can tackle in the fusion area,0.86,123
2,568,5015.212,5024.954,so another fascinating place in a paper titled pushing the frontiers of density functions by solving the fraction electron problem so you're taking on.,0.91,123
2,569,5025.042,5030.122,Modeling and simulating the quantum mechanical behavior of electrons yes.,0.91,123
2,570,5030.776,5038.26,Can you explain this work in can AI model and simulate arbitrary quantum mechanical systems in the future,0.8300000000000001,124
2,571,5038.041,5044.66,yeah so this is not a problem I've had my eye on for you know decade or more which is,0.85,124
2,572,5044.477,5050.26,sort of simulating the properties of electrons if you can do that you can basically describe,0.9,124
2,573,5050.158,5062.953,how elements and materials and substances work so it's kind of like fundamental if you want to advance Material Science and you know we have Schrodinger's equation and then we have approximation to that,0.85,124
2,574,5062.725,5066.626,density functional Theory these things are you know a famous,0.79,124
2,575,5066.407,5075.952,and people try and write approximations to to these to these functionals and and kind of come up with descriptions of the electron clouds,0.85,124
2,576,5075.734,5094.011,where they're going to go how they're going to interact when you put two elements together and what we try to do is learn a simulation learn a functional that will describe more chemistry types of chemistry so until now you know you can run expensive simulations but then you can only simulate very small,0.91,124
2,577,5093.756,5098.701,molecules very simple molecules we would like to simulate large materials,0.91,124
2,578,5098.447,5107.334,and so today there's no way of doing that and we're building up towards building functionals that approximate Schrodinger's equation,0.9,124
2,579,5107.079,5117.228,and then allow you to describe what the electrons are doing and all material sort of Science and material properties are governed by the electrons and how they interact.,0.86,124
2,580,5117.198,5124.33,So I have a good summarization of the simulation through the functional.,0.81,125
2,581,5124.535,5131.299,But one that is still close to what the actual simulation would come out with so what.,0.91,126
2,582,5131.484,5144.136,How difficult a task was involved in that task is running those those complicated simulations and learning the task of mapping from the initial conditions and the parameters of the simulation learning what the functional would be yeah.,0.8300000000000001,127
2,583,5144.241,5164.12,So it's pretty tricky and we've done it with you know the nice thing is We There are we can run a lot of the simulations that the molecular Dynamic simulations on our compute clusters and so that generates a lot of data so in this case the data is generated so we like those sites sort of systems in this why we use games it's simulator generator data,0.8200000000000001,127
2,584,5163.892,5171.304,and we can kind of create as much of it as we want really and just list leave some you know if any computers are free in the cloud,0.88,127
2,585,5171.122,5176.274,we just run we run some of these calculations right compute cluster calculation like saw the the.,0.91,127
2,586,5176.289,5182.117,Computer Chimes used up on quantum mechanics quantum mechanics exactly simulations and protein simulations and other things,0.81,127
2,587,5182.114,5196.736,and so and so you know when you're not searching on YouTube for video cat videos we're using those completed usefully and quantum chemistry the idea by and and putting them to good use and then yeah and then all of that computation or data that's generated,0.79,127
2,588,5196.697,5205.72,we can then try and learn the functionals from that which of course a way more efficient once we learn the functional then running those simulations would be,0.87,127
2,589,5205.699,5215.146,do you think one day a I may allow us to do something like basically crack open physics so do something like travel faster than the speed of light.,0.8200000000000001,127
2,590,5215.332,5220.115,My ultimate aim is always been with AI is the reason I am.,0.87,128
2,591,5220.166,5229.739,Personally working on AI for my whole life it was to build a tool to help us understand still and stand the universe so I wanted to and that means physics really,0.78,128
2,592,5229.636,5232.439,and the nature of reality so.,0.91,128
2,593,5232.508,5241.342,I don't think we have systems that capable of doing that yet but it when we get towards AGI I think that's one of the first things I think we should apply AGI to,0.77,128
2,594,5241.141,5248.904,I would like to test the limits of physics and our knowledge of physics there's so many things we don't know I there's one thing I find fascinating about science and,0.84,128
2,595,5248.703,5256.223,you know is a huge proponent of the scientific method as being one of the greatest ideas Humanities ever had and allowed us to progress with our knowledge,0.87,128
2,596,5256.157,5269.411,but I think as a true scientist I think what you find is the more you find out you know the more you realize we don't know and and I always think that it's surprising that more people don't aren't quite bald you know every night I think about,0.74,128
2,597,5269.274,5273.561,all these things we interact with all the time that we have no idea how they work time.,0.91,128
2,598,5273.819,5282.644,Consciousness gravity life we can't I mean these are all the fundamental things of nature I think we don't really know what they are.,0.91,129
2,599,5283.164,5284.589,To live life,0.91,130
2,600,5284.505,5297.921,we pin certain assumptions on them and kind of treat our assumptions is if they're fact yeah that allows us to sort of box them off somehow yeah box them off so yeah well you're the reality is when you think of time.,0.75,130
2,601,5298.18,5300.037,You should remind yourself you should.,0.91,131
2,602,5300.385,5313.217,Put it off the take it off the shelf and realize like know we have a bunch of assumptions there's still a lot of there's even a lot of debate there's a lot of uncertainty about exactly what is time is there an arrow of time.,0.8300000000000001,132
2,603,5313.376,5320.769,You know there's a lot of fundamental questions that you can just make assumptions about and maybe a i allows you to.,0.85,132
2,604,5321.432,5331.671,Not put anything on the Shelf yeah well make any hard assumptions and really open it up and see what exactly I think we should be truly open minded about that and,0.8,133
2,605,5331.659,5340.862,exactly that not be dogmatic to a particular Theory will also allow us to build better tools experimental tools eventually.,0.73,133
2,606,5341.256,5346.461,That can then test certain theories that may not be testable today about those things about like.,0.88,134
2,607,5346.702,5354.014,What we spoke about the beginning about the computational nature of the universe how one might if that was true how one might go about testing that,0.91,135
2,608,5353.967,5362.981,right and and how much you know there are people who've congested people like Scott Aaronson and others about you know how much information can a specific,0.8200000000000001,135
2,609,5362.96,5370.57,Planck unit of space and time contain right so one might be able to think about testing those ideas if you had.,0.81,135
2,610,5370.684,5379.779,A I helping you build some new Exquisite experimental tools this is what I imagine the you know many decades from now will be able to do.,0.89,135
2,611,5379.794,5381.517,And what kind of.,0.91,135
2,612,5381.622,5396.334,Questions could be answered through running a simulation of them this or that there's a bunch of physics simulations you can imagine that could be run in an so some kind of efficient way much like you're doing in the quantum simulation work.,0.8,135
2,613,5396.664,5400.656,And perhaps even the origin of Life figuring out how,0.87,136
2,614,5400.617,5406.903,going even back before the work of Alpha V begins of how this whole thing,0.89,136
2,615,5406.819,5413.817,emerges from a rock yes from a static thing Woody what do you think AI will allow us to,0.81,136
2,616,5413.688,5422.143,is that something you have your eye on is trying to understand the origin of Life first of all yourself what do you think,0.91,136
2,617,5422.105,5430.804,how the heck did life originate on Earth yeah well maybe week I'll come to that in a second but I think the ultimate use of AI is too.,0.89,136
2,618,5430.855,5435.395,Kind of use it to accelerate science to the maximum so.,0.8200000000000001,136
2,619,5435.41,5441.561,Think of it a little bit like the tree of all knowledge the Imagine that's all the knowledge there is in the universe to attain.,0.76,136
2,620,5441.676,5454.372,And we sort of barely scratched the surface of that so far in even though you know we've done pretty well since the enlightenment right as humanity and I think AI will turbocharged all of that like we've seen with Alpha fold.,0.86,137
2,621,5454.45,5460.098,And I want to explore as much of that tree of knowledge as it's possible to do and.,0.89,137
2,622,5460.149,5465.049,And I think that involves AI helping us with with a with understanding or finding patterns.,0.84,137
2,623,5465.109,5478.516,Um that also potentially designing and building new tools experimental tools so I think that's all and also running simulations and learning simulations all of that we already we're sort of doing at a at a,0.91,137
2,624,5478.369,5487.41,at a baby steps level here but I can imagine that in in the decades to come as you know what's the full flourishing.,0.68,137
2,625,5487.489,5491.074,Of that line of thinking it's going to be truly incredible I would say,0.88,137
2,626,5490.999,5498.267,I visualize this tree of knowledge something tells me that that knowledge for tree of knowledge for humans is much smaller.,0.8200000000000001,137
2,627,5498.741,5504.317,In the set of all possible trees of knowledge is actually quite small given our cognitive.,0.85,138
2,628,5504.755,5515.669,Limitations limited cognitive capabilities that even with the with the tools we build we still won't be able to understand a lot of things and that's perhaps what.,0.88,139
2,629,5515.783,5524.382,Non-human systems may be up to reach farther not just as tools but in themselves understanding something that they can bring back.,0.91,139
2,630,5524.883,5533.042,It could well be so I mean there's so many things that are that are sort of encapsulated in what you just said there I think first of all.,0.91,140
2,631,5533.139,5543.116,There's there's two different things as like what do we understand today yeah what could the human mind understand and what is the totality of what is there to be understood right and so,0.91,140
2,632,5543.087,5555.062,that's three concentric and I can think of them as three larger larger trees or exploring more branches of that tree and I think with a i we're going to explore that whole lot now the question is is you know if you think about,0.73,140
2,633,5554.979,5558.735,what is the totality of what could be understood,0.91,140
2,634,5558.552,5574.129,there may be some fundamental physics reasons why certain things can't be understood like what's outside a simulation or outside the universe maybe it's not understandable from within the universe so that's there may be some hard constraints like that you know could be smaller constraints like we,0.91,140
2,635,5574.054,5581.259,think of space-time as fundamental as our human brains are really used to this idea of a three-dimensional world with time right,0.88,140
2,636,5581.13,5591.611,maybe without tools could go beyond that they wouldn't have that limitation necessary they could think in 11-12 Dimensions whatever is needed but we could still maybe understand that,0.77,140
2,637,5591.546,5603.35,in several different ways the example I always give is when I you know play Garry Kasparov at speed chess or we've talked about Chess and these kind of things you know he if you if you if you're reasonably good at chess.,0.89,140
2,638,5603.419,5612.37,You can you can't come up with the move Gary comes up with in his move but he can explain it to you and you can understand you can understand post hoc the,0.8300000000000001,141
2,639,5612.359,5620.283,yeah so so I think there's a there's an even further level of like well maybe you couldn't have invented that thing but but using like going back to using language again,0.76,141
2,640,5620.208,5627.044,perhaps you can understand and appreciate that same way that you can appreciate you know Vivaldi or Mozart something without,0.88,141
2,641,5626.979,5637.271,you can appreciate the beauty of that without being able to construct it yourself right invent the music yourself so I think we see this in all forms of life so it'll be that times you know.,0.88,141
2,642,5637.34,5644.743,I'm million but it would you can imagine also one sign of intelligence is the ability to explain things clearly and simply,0.75,142
2,643,5644.542,5650.459,why people are rich or find another one of my all-time Heroes used to say that right if you can't you know if you can explain it,0.74,142
2,644,5650.322,5660.407,something simply they need that's it that's the best sign a complex topic simply then that's one of the best songs of you understanding it yeah so I can see myself talking trash in the eye system and that way,0.67,142
2,645,5660.26,5670.183,yes it's a gets frustrated how dumb I am and it tried to explain something to me was like well that means you're not intelligent because if you were intelligent you be able to explain it simply,0.8300000000000001,142
2,646,5670.054,5685.721,yeah of course I mean that there's also the other option of course we could enhance ourselves and and without devices we are already sort of symbiotic with our compute devices right with our phones and other things and you know this stuff like neural link and accept sure that could be could advance that further,0.78,142
2,647,5685.502,5693.967,so I think there's lots of lots of really amazing possibilities that I could foresee from here well let me ask you some wild question so out there.,0.88,142
2,648,5693.974,5695.75,Looking for friends,0.91,142
2,649,5695.72,5704.968,do you think there's a lot of alien civilizations out there so I guess this also goes back to your origin of Life question to you because I think that that's key.,0.9,142
2,650,5705.253,5717.517,My personal opinion looking at all this and and you know it's one of my hobbies physics I guess so so I you know it's what I something I think about a lot and talk to a lot of experts on and read a lot of books on and I think.,0.8,143
2,651,5718.046,5727.96,My feeling currently is that that we are alone I think that's the most likely scenario given what what evidence we have so and the reasoning is I think that.,0.88,144
2,652,5728.677,5730.058,You know we've tried,0.91,145
2,653,5730.001,5739.842,since things like seti program and I guess since the dawning of the the Space Age we've you know had telescopes open radio telescopes and other things and,0.8300000000000001,145
2,654,5739.84,5747.918,if you think about and try to detect signals now if you think about the evolution of humans on Earth we could have easily been.,0.84,145
2,655,5747.996,5755.443,And Milling is ahead of our time now or million years behind right easily with just some slightly different quirk,0.85,146
2,656,5755.377,5763.744,thing happening hundreds of thousands years ago you know things could have been slightly different if the BET award hit the dinosaurs a Milling is earlier maybe things would have evolved,0.88,146
2,657,5763.507,5788.932,we be Milling is at the head of where we are now so what that means is if you imagine where Humanity will be in a few hundred years let alone a million years especially if we hopefully you know solve things like climate change and other things and we continue to flourish and we build things like Ai and we do space traveling and all of the stuff that that humans have dreamed of forever right and sci-fi is talked about forever,0.66,146
2,658,5788.731,5792.299,we will be spreading across the Stars,0.88,146
2,659,5792.089,5817.703,right and Von Neumann famously calculated you know it would only take about a million years if you send out Von Neumann probes to the nearest you know the nearest other solar systems and and then they built all they did was built two more versions themselves and set those two out to the next nearest systems you know with in a million years I think you would have one of these probes in every system in the Galaxy so it's not actually in Cosmo cosmological time that's actually very short amount of time,0.81,146
2,660,5817.467,5827.057,so and you know we have people like Dyson of thought about constructing Dyson spheres around stars to collect all the energy coming out of the star you know that they would be,0.84,146
2,661,5826.819,5829.424,constructions like that would be visible across base.,0.6900000000000001,146
2,662,5829.449,5841.146,Um probably even across the Galaxy so and then you know if you think about all of our radio television emissions that have gone out since since the you know 30s and 40s,0.91,147
2,663,5841.007,5847.438,imagine a million years of that and now hundreds of civilizations doing that when we opened our area is,0.87,147
2,664,5847.417,5852.605,at this point we got technologically sophisticated enough in the Space Age we should have.,0.76,147
2,665,5853.043,5859.87,Heard a cacophony of voices should have joined a cacophony of voices and what we did we open our ears and we heard nothing,0.81,148
2,666,5859.795,5874.633,and many people who argue that there are aliens would say well we haven't really done exhaustive search yet and maybe we're looking in the wrong bands and and we've got the wrong devices and we wouldn't notice what an alien form was likely be so different to what we're used to but,0.89,148
2,667,5874.559,5883.213,you know I know I don't really buy that that it shouldn't be as difficult as that like we I think we've searched enough there should be if it were everywhere if it was at yeah it should be everywhere,0.88,148
2,668,5883.174,5892.53,we should see Dyson spheres being put up son's blinking in and out you know there should be a lot of evidence for those things and then there are other people argue well the sort of safari view of like well we're,0.76,148
2,669,5892.492,5903.234,A Primitive species still cannot spacefaring out and and and we're you know there's some kind of global like Universal rule not to interfere Star Trek will but like look we can't even called me humans,0.8,148
2,670,5903.204,5917.719,to deal with climate change and where one species what it what is the chance that of all of these different human civilization you know alien civilizations they would have the same priorities and and and and agree or cross the you know these kind of matters and even if that was true.,0.87,148
2,671,5917.716,5930.583,And we were in some sort of Safar week for our own good to me that's not much different from the simulation hypothesis because what does it mean the simulation hypothesis I think in its most fundamental level it means what we're seeing is not quite reality,0.85,149
2,672,5930.517,5936.101,what it's something there's something more deeper underlying it may be computational now if we were in a,0.79,149
2,673,5936.008,5947.444,if we were in a sort of safari park and everything we were seeing was a hologram and is projected by the aliens or whatever that to me is not much different than thinking we're inside of Another Universe because we still can't see,0.75,149
2,674,5947.378,5952.387,true reality right I mean there's there's other explanations it could be that.,0.71,149
2,675,5952.618,5963.396,The way they're communicating is just fundamentally different that were too dumb to understand the much better methods of communication that have it could be I mean it's silly to say but,0.8200000000000001,150
2,676,5963.339,5972.992,our own thoughts could be the methods by which they're communicating like the place for which your ideas writers talk about this like the Muse yeah the the,0.84,150
2,677,5972.953,5983.219,it sounds like very kind of wild but it could be thoughts it could be some interactions with our mind that we think are originating from.,0.79,150
2,678,5983.315,5986.199,Us is actually something that.,0.91,150
2,679,5986.997,6000.756,Coming from other life forms elsewhere Consciousness itself might be that it could be but I couldn't see any sensible argument to the why would all of the alien species be using this way yes some of them will be more primitive they would be close to our level.,0.85,151
2,680,6000.77,6010.298,You know they would there should be a whole sort of normal distribution of these things right some would be aggressive some would be spent you know a curious others would be very stoic:,0.87,151
2,681,6010.277,6016.96,philosophical because you know maybe there are million years older than us but it's not it shouldn't be like what I mean one,0.91,151
2,682,6016.93,6030.805,one alien civilization might be like that communicating thoughts and others but I don't see why you know potentially the hundreds they should be would be uniform in this way right it could be a violent dictatorship that do the people the alien civilizations that.,0.8300000000000001,151
2,683,6031.189,6035.198,Become successful become.,0.91,152
2,684,6036.06,6044.731,Gain the ability to be destructive an order of magnitude more destructive but of course the the sad thought.,0.84,153
2,685,6045.746,6053.454,Wow either humans are very special we took a lot of leaps that arrived at what it means to be human yeah.,0.91,154
2,686,6053.623,6063.6,There's a question there which was the hardest which was the most special but also others have reached this level I may be many others have reached this level,0.9,154
2,687,6063.543,6065.959,the great filter.,0.91,154
2,688,6066.226,6078.112,That's prevented them from going farther to becoming a multiplanetary species are reaching out into the stars and those are really important questions for us weather.,0.9,155
2,689,6078.325,6088.096,Whether there's other alien civilizations out there are not this is very useful for us to think about if we destroy ourselves how will we do it and how easy is it to do,0.91,155
2,690,6088.092,6095.27,yeah well he and these are Big questions and I thought about these a lot but the interesting thing is that if we're if we're alone.,0.73,155
2,691,6095.717,6101.455,That's somewhat comforting from the great filter perspective because it probably means the great filters were Behar past us,0.86,156
2,692,6101.398,6109.188,I'm pretty sure they are so the buy-in going back to your origin of Life question there are some incredible things that no one knows how happened like obviously the first.,0.84,156
2,693,6109.293,6113.077,Life form from chemical soup that's seems pretty hard,0.84,156
2,694,6112.948,6126.986,but I would suggest the multicellular I wouldn't be that surprised if we saw a single level such as single cells sort of life forms elsewhere bacterial type things but multicellular life seems incredibly hard that step of you know capturing mitochondria and then.,0.8200000000000001,156
2,695,6127.001,6134.178,Sort of using that as part of yourself you know when you've just eaten would you say that's the biggest the most like.,0.85,156
2,696,6135.066,6142.866,If you had to choose one sort of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy one sentence summary of like oh those clever creatures,0.8,157
2,697,6142.764,6152.542,did this that would be the Multiverse I think that's probably the one that's the biggest I mean there's a great book called The 10 grand in four great inventions of evolution by Nick Lane any speculates on 10,0.79,157
2,698,6152.45,6165.866,ten of these you know what could be great filters I think that's one I think the Advent of of intelligence and conscious intelligence and in order to you know to us to be able to do science and things like that is huge as well,0.81,157
2,699,6165.701,6179.414,I mean it's only evolved once as far as you know in Earth history so that would be a later candidate but there's certainly for the early candidates I think multicellular life forms is huge by the way work it's interesting to ask you,0.79,157
2,700,6179.367,6186.58,if you can hypothesize about what is the origin of intelligence is it that we started.,0.89,157
2,701,6186.983,6194.458,Cooking meat over fire is it that we somehow figured out that we could be very powerful and start collaborating so,0.9,158
2,702,6194.427,6199.337,cooperation between our ancestors.,0.91,158
2,703,6199.36,6205.989,So that we can overthrow the alpha male what is it Richard I talked to Richard random who thinks we're all just,0.84,158
2,704,6205.878,6214.514,beta males who figured out how to collaborate to defeat the one that the dictator that authored Terrian alpha male that control the tribe.,0.68,158
2,705,6214.7,6221.797,Is there another explanation did was there 2001 Space Odyssey type of monolith yeah they came down to earth,0.85,159
2,706,6221.74,6227.82,well I think I think all of those things you suggest a good candidates fire and and cooking right so,0.78,159
2,707,6227.78,6233.608,that's clearly modern fan it for energy you know Energy Efficiency cooking our meat and then.,0.77,159
2,708,6233.641,6242.241,And then being able to to be more efficient about eating it and getting a consuming the energy I didn't ask you Jin then utilizing fire and tools,0.84,160
2,709,6242.194,6255.349,I think you're right about the the tribal Corporation aspects and probably language as part of that yes because probably that's what allowed us to out-compete neanderthals and and perhaps less Cooperative species so so that may be the case,0.79,160
2,710,6255.139,6257.491,tool making Spears axes.,0.66,160
2,711,6257.506,6269.32,I think that let us I mean I think it's pretty clear now that humans were responsible for a lot of the extensions of megafauna especially in Norton in the Americas when humans arrived so you can imagine,0.85,160
2,712,6269.128,6278.566,once you discover tool usage how powerful that would have been and how scary for animals so I think all of those could have been explanations for it now the interesting thing is,0.91,160
2,713,6278.535,6282.661,that is a bit like general intelligence to is it's very costly to begin with,0.84,160
2,714,6282.587,6296.543,to have a brain and especially a general-purpose brain rather than special-purpose one because he might have energy our brains use I think it's like 20% of the body's energy and its massive and then you're thinking chess one of the funny things are that we used to say is it as much as,0.81,160
2,715,6296.513,6299.793,a racing driver uses for a whole you know Formula One race,0.84,160
2,716,6299.763,6310.712,if just playing a game of you know serious high-level chess which we know you wouldn't think just sitting there because the brains using so much energy so in order for an animal an organism to justify that,0.81,160
2,717,6310.637,6313.602,there has to be a huge payoff.,0.8,160
2,718,6313.725,6323.162,And the problem with with half a brain or path you know intelligence saying IQs of you know of like a monkey brain it's.,0.91,161
2,719,6323.466,6338.43,It's not clear you can justify that evolutionary until you get to the humor level brain and so but how do you how do you do that jump it's very difficult which is why I think it's only been done once from the sort of specialized brains that you see an animal's to this sort of general purpose,0.8,162
2,720,6338.355,6342.22,cheering powerful brains that humans have,0.91,162
2,721,6342.047,6358.19,and which allows us to invent the modern modern world and you know it takes a lot to to cross that barrier and I think we've seen the same with AI systems which is that maybe until very recently it's always been easier to craft a specific solution to a problem like chess.,0.89,162
2,722,6358.197,6369.803,Then it has been to build a general Learning System that can potentially do many things because initially that system will be way worse than less efficient than the specialized system so one of the interesting,0.91,162
2,723,6369.675,6377.311,corks of the human mind of this evolved system is that it appears to be conscious,0.86,162
2,724,6377.191,6381.47,this thing that we don't quite understand but it seems very,0.91,162
2,725,6381.413,6392.435,very special ability to have a subjective experience that it feels like something to eat a cookie the deliciousness of it or see a color and that kind of stuff do you think,0.85,162
2,726,6392.261,6400.807,in order to solve intelligence we also need to solve Consciousness along the way do you think AGI systems need to have Consciousness in order to.,0.89,162
2,727,6401.029,6403.886,Be truly intelligent,0.91,163
2,728,6403.829,6411.691,yeah we thought about this a lot actually and I think that my guess is that Consciousness and intelligence are double dissociable,0.86,163
2,729,6411.661,6419.01,so you can have one without the other both ways and I think you can see that with Consciousness in that I think some animals,0.84,163
2,730,6418.989,6427.4,pets if you have a pet dog or something like that you can see some of the higher animals and dolphins things like that are have self-awareness.,0.88,163
2,731,6427.514,6431.91,And a very sociable seem to dream,0.9,164
2,732,6431.709,6440.354,you know those kinds of a lot of the traits one would regard as being kind of conscious and self-aware and but yet they're not that smart,0.91,164
2,733,6440.18,6448.753,right so they're not that intelligent bye-bye say IQ standards or something like that yeah it's also possible that our understanding of intelligence is flawed,0.8,164
2,734,6448.678,6458.485,like putting an IQ to it sure maybe the thing that a dog can do is actually gone a very far along the path of intelligence that we humans are just able to,0.85,164
2,735,6458.374,6470.17,play chess and maybe write poems right but if we go back to the idea of AGI and general intelligence you know dogs are very specialized white most animals are pretty specialized they can be amazing at what they do but they're like kind of Elite Sports,0.8,164
2,736,6470.086,6473.293,Sports people or something right so they are they having,0.76,164
2,737,6473.11,6494.701,extremely well because the entire brain is optimized if somehow convince the entirety of the human population to feed them and service them so in some way they're controlling yes exactly what we co-evolved to some crazy degree right including the the way the dogs you know even even wag their tails and twist their noses right we find we finding inexorably cute yeah,0.8300000000000001,164
2,738,6494.491,6501.039,but I think you can also see Intelligence on the other side so systems like artificial systems that are amazingly.,0.81,164
2,739,6501.216,6514.236,Smalt at certain things like maybe playing go and chess and some other things but they don't feel at all in any shape or form conscious in the way that you know you do to me or I do to you and.,0.76,165
2,740,6514.548,6517.26,And I think actually building a.,0.91,166
2,741,6517.293,6526.164,Is these intelligent constructs is one of the best ways to explore the mystery of Consciousness to break it down because we're going to have,0.9,166
2,742,6526.116,6529.45,devices that are pretty smart,0.91,166
2,743,6529.383,6538.308,at certain things or capable certain things but potentially won't have any semblance of self-awareness or other things and in fact I would advocate.,0.85,166
2,744,6538.503,6539.848,If there's a choice,0.91,166
2,745,6539.718,6554.341,Building Systems in the first place AI systems that are not conscious to begin with I just tools until we understand them better and and the capabilities better so on the topic just not as the CEO of deepmind.,0.79,166
2,746,6554.716,6562.668,Just as a human being let me ask you about this one particular anecdotal evidence of the Google engineer who made a comment.,0.8,167
2,747,6562.917,6571.689,Or believed that there are some aspect of language model the Lambda language model that exhibited sentience.,0.91,168
2,748,6571.811,6580.097,See said you believe there might be a responsibility to build systems that are not sentient and this experience of a particular engineer I think.,0.77,168
2,749,6580.337,6585.101,Lot to get your general opinion this kind of thing but I think it will happen more and more and more.,0.72,168
2,750,6585.432,6595.527,Which not one Engineers but when people out there that don't have an engineering background start interacting with increasingly intelligent systems we anthropomorphize them,0.84,169
2,751,6595.524,6606.653,they start to have deep impactful interactions with us in a way that we miss them yeah when they're gone and we sure as heck feel like.,0.8,169
2,752,6606.74,6614.512,Living entities self-aware entities and maybe even we project sentience onto them so what's your thought about this particular.,0.8300000000000001,169
2,753,6614.842,6616.988,System was is.,0.91,170
2,754,6617.174,6625.81,Have you ever met a language model that sentient not recognize no no what do you make of the case of when you kind of feel.,0.8,170
2,755,6625.933,6628.582,That there's some elements of sentience to this system.,0.87,170
2,756,6628.76,6642.959,Yeah so this is you know an interesting question and you'll see a very fundamental one so the first thing to say is I think that none of the systems we have today I would say even have one iota of semblance of Consciousness or sentience that's my.,0.7000000000000001,171
2,757,6643.011,6657.12,Personal feeling interacting with them every day so I think this way premature to be discussing what that engineer talked about I preach I think at the moment it's more of a projection of our the way our own minds work which is to see,0.78,171
2,758,6657.054,6669.498,sort of purpose and direction in almost anything that we you know our brains are trained to interpret agency basically in things even in an inanimate things sometimes and of course with.,0.91,171
2,759,6669.513,6678.581,A language system because language is so fundamental to intelligence that's going to be easy for us to anthropomorphize that I mean back in the day even the first.,0.91,171
2,760,6678.677,6686.287,The dumbest sort of template chatbots ever Eliza and and and and the ilk of the original chatbots back in the 60s,0.81,171
2,761,6686.194,6695.262,full some people under certain circumstances right a bit tender to be a psychologist so just basically rabbit back to you the same question you asked it back to you,0.74,171
2,762,6695.052,6709.756,and some people believe that so I don't think we can this is why I think the Turing test is a little bit flawed as a formal test because it depends on the sophistication of the of the judge whether or not they are qualified to make that distinction so.,0.91,171
2,763,6710.14,6724.736,I think we should talk to you know the top philosophers about this people like Daniel Dennett and David Chalmers and others who've obviously thought deeply about consciousness of course Consciousness itself hasn't been well there's no agreed definition if I was,0.9,172
2,764,6724.688,6727.05,you know speculate about that.,0.91,172
2,765,6727.056,6743.28,You know I kind of the deaf at the working definition I like is it's the way information feels when you know it gets processed I think maybe Max tegmark came up with that I like that idea and if it helps us get towards any more operational thing but it's I think it's a nice way of viewing it,0.8200000000000001,172
2,766,6743.052,6754.119,I think we can obviously see from Neuroscience certain prerequisites that are required like self-awareness I think is necessary but not sufficient component this idea of a self and other,0.9,172
2,767,6753.936,6771.296,and self coherent preferences that are coherent overtime you know these things are maybe memory these things are probably needed for a sentient or conscious being but the reason that the difficult thing I think for us when we get and I think this is a really interesting philosophical debate is,0.78,172
2,768,6771.158,6780.955,when we get closer to a GI and and you know and and much more powerful systems than we have today how we going to make this judgment and,0.8,172
2,769,6780.826,6787.751,one way which is the Turing test is sort of a behavioral judgment is is the system exhibiting all the behaviors,0.77,172
2,770,6787.551,6798.644,the human sentient or sentient being would exhibit is it answering the right questions is saying the right things is it indistinguishable from a human and so on.,0.8200000000000001,172
2,771,6799.226,6813.732,But I think there's a second thing that makes us as humans regard each other a sentient why do we why do we think this and I debated this with Daniel Dennett and I think there's a second reason that's over often overlooked which is that we're running on the same substrate,0.84,173
2,772,6813.649,6827.767,right so if we're exhibiting the same behavior more or less as humans and we're running on the same you know carbon-based biological substrate the squishy you know few pounds of Flesh in our skulls then the most parsimonious I think,0.91,173
2,773,6827.638,6836.319,explanation is that you're feeling the same thing as I'm feeling right but we will never have that second part the substrate equivalence with a machine.,0.89,173
2,774,6836.415,6841.864,Right so we will have to only judge based on the behavior and I think the substrate equivalents,0.85,173
2,775,6841.807,6856.241,is a critical part of why we make assumptions that we are conscious and in fact even with with animals high-level animals why we think they might be because they're exhibiting some of the behaviors we would expect from a sentient animal and we know they're made of the same things biological neurons so we're going to have to come up with.,0.8200000000000001,173
2,776,6857.066,6869.51,Explanations or models of the gap between substrate differences between machines and humans did to get anywhere beyond the behavioral but to me the Practical question is.,0.89,174
2,777,6869.688,6879.548,Very interesting very important when you have millions perhaps billions of people believing that you have a sentient AI believing what that Google engineer believed.,0.8200000000000001,174
2,778,6879.896,6887.038,Which I just see is an obvious very near-term future thing certainly on the path to a GI,0.9,175
2,779,6887.008,6896.886,how does that change the world what's the responsibility of the AI system to help those millions of people and also what's the ethical thing because,0.91,175
2,780,6896.856,6905.42,you can you can make a lot of people happy by creating a meaningful deep experience with the system.,0.84,175
2,781,6905.931,6915.458,That's faking it before makes it yeah and I don't is a weed the right who is this a what's the right thing to do.,0.86,176
2,782,6915.563,6923.002,Should a I always be tools like shy what why are we constraining I asked those be tools as opposed to.,0.8,177
2,783,6923.071,6930.104,Friends yeah I think well I mean these are you know that you know fantastic questions and also critical ones,0.79,177
2,784,6929.904,6945.67,and we've been thinking about this since the start of the mine and before that because we plan for success and you know how you know have a remote that look like back in 2010 and we've always had sort of these ethical considerations as fundamental a deep mind,0.77,177
2,785,6945.505,6951.953,my current thinking on the language models is and and large models is they're not ready we don't understand them well enough yet.,0.84,177
2,786,6952.04,6961.351,And you know in terms of analysis tools and and guardrails what they can and can't do and so on to deploy them at scale because I think,0.8,177
2,787,6961.15,6968.913,you know there are big still ethical questions like should an AI system always announce that it is an AI system to begin with probably yes,0.88,177
2,788,6968.721,6980.409,it what do you do about answering those philosophical questions about the feelings people may have about AI systems perhaps incorrectly attributed so I think there's a whole bunch of research that needs to be done first.,0.85,177
2,789,6980.488,6989.349,To responsibly before we you know you can responsibly deploy these systems at scale that would be at least be my current position over time,0.81,177
2,790,6989.265,7000.412,I'm very confident we'll have those tools to like interpretability questions and Analysis questions and then with the ethical quandary you know I think.,0.78,177
2,791,7000.895,7007.686,It's important to look Beyond just science that's why I think philosophy social sciences,0.86,178
2,792,7007.584,7019.434,even theology other things like that come into it where would it you know Arts and Humanities what what does it mean to be human and the spirit of Being Human and and to enhance that and and The Human Condition,0.8,178
2,793,7019.314,7027.563,right and allow us to experience things we could never experience before and improve the overall Human Condition and Humanity overall you know get radical abundance,0.8300000000000001,178
2,794,7027.497,7036.61,so many scientific problem solved disease so this is the era I think this is the amazing ear I think we're heading into if we do it right but we've got to be careful.,0.76,178
2,795,7036.644,7045.856,We've already seen with things like social media how dual-use Technologies can be misused by firstly by bad Hyuna p Bad actors,0.87,179
2,796,7045.781,7047.953,naive actors or crazy actors,0.77,179
2,797,7047.878,7056.073,right so there's that set of just the common or garden use misuse of existing dual-use technology and then of course there's an additional,0.8300000000000001,179
2,798,7055.864,7068.802,thing that has to be overcome with a either eventually it may have its own agency so it could be good or bad in it in a bit self so I think these questions have to be approached very carefully,0.8300000000000001,179
2,799,7069.267,7080.1,using the scientific method I would say in terms of hypothesis generation careful control testing not live a be testing out in the world because with powerful to do with Technologies like AI,0.87,179
2,800,7079.882,7096.566,if something goes wrong it may cause you know a lot of harm before you can fix it it's not like a you know an imaging app or game app where you know the if if something goes wrong it's relatively easy to fix and the harm is relatively small so I think it comes with you know the,0.87,179
2,801,7096.355,7099.464,the usual cliche of light with a lot of,0.81,179
2,802,7099.435,7107.71,power comes a lot of responsibility and I think that's the case here with things like AI given the enormous opportunity in front of us and I think.,0.86,179
2,803,7107.815,7114.894,We need a lot of voices and as many inputs into things like the design of the systems and the values,0.91,180
2,804,7114.855,7122.465,they should have and what goals should they be put to I think as wider group of voices as possible beyond just the technologist is needed,0.9,180
2,805,7122.408,7134.483,add to input into that and to have a say in that especially when it comes to deployment of these systems which is when the rubber really hits the road it really affects the general person in the street rather than fundamental research and that's why I say.,0.8300000000000001,180
2,806,7134.966,7140.694,I think as a first step it would be better if we have the choice to build these systems as tools,0.89,181
2,807,7140.493,7145.826,to give and I'm not saying that it should never they should never go beyond tools because of course the potential is there,0.85,181
2,808,7145.625,7156.682,way to go way Beyond just tools but I think that would be a good first step in order for us to you know allow us to carefully experiment understand what these things can do,0.78,181
2,809,7156.572,7171.671,so the leap between tool to sentient entity being as long as you take very careful yes let me ask a dark personal question so you're one of the most brilliant people in the a community also one of the most,0.91,181
2,810,7180.014,7185.211,creation of a super intelligent AI system would be one of the most.,0.9,181
2,811,7185.532,7198.993,Powerful things in the world tools or otherwise and again as the old saying goes power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely you are,0.91,182
2,812,7198.855,7200.587,likely.,0.91,182
2,813,7201.07,7210.868,To be one of the people but I would say probably the most likely person to be in the control such a system do you think about.,0.9,183
2,814,7210.963,7223.408,The corrupting nature of power when you talk about these kinds of systems that as all dictators and people have caused atrocities in the past always think they're doing good.,0.91,183
2,815,7223.584,7235.983,But they don't do good because the power is polluted their mind about what is good and what is evil do you think about the stuff are we just focused on language model yeah I think about them all the time and you know I think.,0.85,183
2,816,7236.494,7244.5,What are the defenses against that I think one thing is to remain very grounded and sort of humble no matter what you do or achieve.,0.84,184
2,817,7244.668,7255.014,And I tried to do that I might you know my best friends are still my set of friends from my undergraduate Cambridge days my family's you know and and friends are very important.,0.89,184
2,818,7255.092,7258.39,I've always I think trying to be a multidisciplinary person,0.86,185
2,819,7258.217,7266.979,it helps to keep you humble because no matter how good you are at one topic someone will be better than you at that and it and always re learning a new topic again from scratch,0.87,185
2,820,7266.787,7272.262,is a new field is very humbling right so for me that's been biology over the last five years,0.91,185
2,821,7272.044,7296.911,you know huge area topic and and and it spins and I just love doing that but it helps to keep you grounded like and keeps you open-minded and and then the other important thing is to have a really group amazing set of people around you at your company or your organization who are also very ethical and grounded themselves and help to keep you that way and then ultimately just to answer your question I hope we're going to be a big part of,0.76,185
2,822,7296.692,7312.215,of birthing Ai and that being the greatest benefit to humanity of any tool or technology ever and and getting out into a world of radical abundance and curing diseases and and and and solving many of the big challenges we have in front of us and then ultimately,0.84,185
2,823,7311.996,7321.901,you know help the ultimate flourishing of humanity to travel the stars and find those aliens if they are there and if they're not there find out why they're not there what is going on here in the universe.,0.8200000000000001,185
2,824,7321.709,7330.264,Um this is all to come and and that's what I've always dreamed about but I don't think I think AI is too big an idea it's not going to be,0.87,186
2,825,7330.073,7339.618,Adele be a certain set of pioneers who get their first I hope to other we're in the Vanguard so we can influence how that goes and I think it matters who builds who which which,0.73,186
2,826,7339.426,7348.926,cultures they come from and what values they have the Builders of AI systems because I think even though the AI system is going to learn for itself most of its knowledge they'll be a residue,0.89,186
2,827,7348.725,7357.163,in the system of the culture and the values of the creators of the system and there's interesting questions to discuss about that geopolitically.,0.87,186
2,828,7357.196,7363.267,You know different cultures as we're going to more fragmented while than ever unfortunately I think in terms of global cooperation,0.79,187
2,829,7363.038,7380.317,we see that in things like climate where we can't seem to get our act together globally to cooperate on these pressing matters I hope that will change over time perhaps you know if we get to an Era of radical abundance we don't have to be so competitive anymore maybe we can be more Cooperative if resources aren't so scared,0.91,187
2,830,7380.161,7382.873,it's true that in terms of,0.91,187
2,831,7382.762,7396.845,power corrupting and leading to destructive things it seems that some of the atrocities of the past happen when there's a significant constraint on resources I think that's the first thing I don't think that's a no I think scarcity is one thing that's led to,0.81,187
2,832,7396.77,7409.07,competition distract you know sort of Zero Sum game thinking I would like us to all be in a positive some world and I think for that you have to remove scarcity I don't think that's enough unfortunately to get well piece because there's also other corrupting things like,0.74,187
2,833,7409.068,7420.251,wanting power over people and this kind of stuff which is not necessarily Satisfied by by just abundance but I think it will help and I think but I think ultimately AI is not,0.91,187
2,834,7420.113,7430.171,going to be run by any one person or one organization I think it should belong to the world belong to humanity and I think may have been many they'll be many ways this will happen and ultimately,0.8300000000000001,187
2,835,7430.007,7437.167,everybody should have a say in that do you have advice for young people,0.91,187
2,836,7437.092,7444.539,in high school and college maybe if they're interested in AI or interesting having a.,0.91,187
2,837,7444.662,7450.778,A big impact on the world what they should do to have a career that can be proud of her to have a life that could be proud.,0.89,188
2,838,7450.829,7464.254,I love giving talks to the Next Generation what I say to them is actually two things I think the most important things to learn about and to find out about when you're when you're young is what are your true passions is first of all as two things one is,0.85,188
2,839,7464.125,7470.483,find your true passions and I think you can do that by the way to do that is to explore as many things as possible,0.85,188
2,840,7470.48,7485.193,when you're young and you have the time and you can take those risks I would also encourage people to look at the finding the connections between things in a unique way I think that's a really great way to find a passion second thing I would say advises.,0.91,188
2,841,7485.298,7488.407,Know yourself so spend a lot of time.,0.88,188
2,842,7489.016,7495.411,Understanding how you work best like what are the optimal times to work wanted optimal ways that you study,0.8200000000000001,189
2,843,7495.408,7506.439,what are your how do you deal with pressure sort of test yourself in various scenarios and try and improve your weaknesses but also find out what your unique skills and strengths are.,0.91,189
2,844,7506.535,7508.068,And then home those,0.8,189
2,845,7508.011,7518.33,so then that's what your will be your Super Value in the world later on and if you can then combine those two things and find passions that you're genuinely excited about the intersect,0.75,189
2,846,7518.274,7521.202,with what your unique strong skills are.,0.91,189
2,847,7521.217,7529.53,Then you're you know you're onto something incredible and you know I think you can make a huge difference in the world so let me ask about know yourself this is fun,0.8200000000000001,189
2,848,7529.445,7536.84,this is fun quick questions about Day in the Life the perfect day the perfect productive day in the life of domicile yeah.,0.84,189
2,849,7537.043,7540.674,Maybe maybe these days your.,0.89,189
2,850,7540.77,7548.119,There's a lot involved yes maybe a slightly younger Tempest aside yeah when you could focus on a single project Maybe.,0.72,189
2,851,7549.088,7554.403,How early do you wake up what you night owl do you wake up early in the morning what are some interesting habits.,0.74,190
2,852,7554.697,7561.721,How many dozens of cups of coffees do you drink a day what's the computer that you use.,0.8200000000000001,191
2,853,7561.935,7572.786,What's the setup how many screens will kind of keyboard are we talking emacs Vim or we talking something more modern just a bunch of those questions so maybe day in the life,0.8300000000000001,191
2,854,7572.63,7580.86,what what's the perfect day involve well these days it's quite different from say 10 20 years ago back 10 20 years ago it would have been.,0.71,191
2,855,7580.957,7583.633,You know whole day of.,0.9,191
2,856,7583.792,7595.624,Research individual research or programming doing some experiment Neuroscience computer science experiment reading lots of research papers and then perhaps at night time you know,0.89,191
2,857,7595.55,7599.261,reading science fiction books or,0.91,191
2,858,7599.105,7605.914,playing some games but I lots of focus or the Deep focused work on whether it's.,0.81,191
2,859,7605.794,7619.354,Programming or reading research paper yes yes so that would be lots of debris for a now Focus work these days for the last sort of I guess you know five to ten years I've actually got quite a structure that works very well for me now which is that,0.86,192
2,860,7619.162,7636.161,um I'm a Knight complete Night Owl always have been so I optimized for that so you know I get it you know I basically do a normal day as well get into work about 11:00 and sort of do worked about seven in the office and I will arrange back-to-back meetings for the entire time,0.74,192
2,861,7635.979,7647.621,that and with as many meet as many people as possible so that's my collaboration management part of the day then I go home spend time with the family and friends have dinner,0.9,192
2,862,7647.457,7664.24,relax a little bit and then I start a second day of work I call it my second day of work around 10 p.m. 11 p.m. and that's the time to learn about the small hours of the morning for five in the morning where I will do my thinking and reading a research writing research papers,0.87,192
2,863,7664.038,7685.422,um sadly don't have time to code anymore but it's not efficient to to do that these days given them our time I have but that's when I do you know maybe do the long kind of stretches of thinking and planning and then probably you know using using email other things I would set I would fire off a lot of things to my team for to deal with the next morning,0.76,192
2,864,7685.212,7690.796,for actually thinking about this overnight we should go for this project or arrange this meeting the next day.,0.72,192
2,865,7690.667,7700.429,When you think it through a problem I'm talking about sheet of paper with a pen pen is there some it depends structure chili sauce I still like pencil and paper best for working out things.,0.84,193
2,866,7700.417,7712.699,But these days it's just so efficient to read research papers just on the screen my still often print them out actually I still prefer to Mark out things and if I find it goes into the brain quick better and sticks in the brain better when your,0.8300000000000001,194
2,867,7712.48,7722.277,you're still using physical pen and pencil and paper so you take notes with the have lots of notes electronic ones and also whole stacks of notebooks that,0.81,194
2,868,7722.058,7731.063,that I use at home yeah some of these most challenging next steps for example stuff none of us know about that you're working on your thinking.,0.9,194
2,869,7731.403,7737.041,There's some deep thinking required there right like what what is the right problem what is the right approach.,0.85,195
2,870,7737.083,7747.52,Because there you're going to have to invest a huge amount of time for the whole team they're going to have to pursue this thing what's the right way to do it as are all going to work here and yes.,0.87,195
2,871,7747.832,7763.102,What's the right thing to try was the right Benchmark to you you need to construct The Benchmark from scratch all those kinds of things yes so I think of all those kind of things and then might time phase but also much more I find I've always found the quiet hours of the morning,0.86,196
2,872,7762.919,7765.155,when everyone's asleep,0.89,196
2,873,7765.008,7775.741,it's super quiet outside I love that time so the golden hours like between like 1:00 and 3:00 in the morning put some music on some inspiring music on and then,0.8,196
2,874,7775.649,7780.729,I think these deep thoughts so that's when I would read you know my philosophy books and,0.78,196
2,875,7780.537,7788.399,Spinoza is my you know recent favorite can all these things and you know read about a great,0.89,196
2,876,7788.198,7798.994,scientists of History how they did things how they thought things so that's when you do all your create bats when I do all my creative thinking and it's good I think I think people recommend you know you do your,0.77,196
2,877,7798.784,7816.198,you're sort of creative thinking and one block and the way I organize the day that way I don't get interrupted because obviously no one else is up at those times so I can I can go you know it says I can sort of get super deep and super into flow the other nice thing about doing it nighttime wisest,0.91,196
2,878,7816.15,7829.818,if I'm really onto something or if I've got really deep into something I can choose to extend it and I'll go into six in the morning whatever and then I'll just pay for it the next day yeah so I'll be a bit tired and I won't be my best but that's fine,0.76,196
2,879,7829.743,7832.564,I can decide the king my schedule the next day.,0.73,196
2,880,7832.516,7845.635,The and given where I'm at with this particular thought or creative idea that I'm going to pay that cost the next day so I think that's that's more flexible than morning people who do that you know they get up at four in the morning they can also,0.91,197
2,881,7845.479,7854.754,to those golden hours then but then their start of their scheduled day starts at breakfast you know am whatever they have their first meeting and then it's hard you have to reschedule day if you and Flo,0.78,197
2,882,7854.599,7859.76,yeah that could be actually see that special thread of thoughts that the,0.84,197
2,883,7859.622,7874.082,you're too passionate about you that this is where some of the greatest ideas could potentially comments When You're Just Lose Yourself late and yeah and for the meetings I mean you're loading and really hard problems in a very short amount of time so you have to do some kind of first.,0.79,197
2,884,7874.115,7878.853,Suppose thinking here is like what's the problem with the state of things what's the right Next Step.,0.8300000000000001,197
2,885,7878.994,7888.333,You have to get really good at context switching which is one of the hardest things when it because especially as we do so many things if you include all the scientific things we do scientific Fields it working in.,0.8200000000000001,197
2,886,7888.474,7894.716,These are our entire fear you know complex fields in themselves and you you have to sort of keep up to abreast of that.,0.75,197
2,887,7894.865,7903.294,But I enjoy it I've always been a sort of generalist in a way and that's actually what happened to my games career after chess I.,0.9,197
2,888,7903.454,7916.951,One of the reasons I stopped playing chess was I got into computers but also I started realizing there were many other great games out there to play too so I've always been that way inclined multidisciplinary and there's too many interesting things in in the world to spend all your time just on one thing.,0.79,198
2,889,7917.02,7920.606,So you mentioned Spinoza gotta ask the big.,0.72,198
2,890,7920.756,7929.996,Ridiculously big Russian about life what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing why are we humans here you've already mentioned that.,0.77,198
2,891,7930.074,7932.534,Perhaps the universe created us hmm.,0.87,198
2,892,7932.576,7944.534,Is that why you think we're here to understand how the universe yeah I think my answer to that would be and at least that the the life I'm living is to gain and to gain and understand the knowledge you know too,0.8200000000000001,198
2,893,7944.513,7948.081,gain knowledge and understand the universe that's what I think.,0.9,198
2,894,7948.105,7957.83,I can't see any higher purpose than that if you think back to the classical Greeks you know the virtue of gaining knowledge it's I think it's one of the few true virtues is to understand.,0.88,198
2,895,7957.882,7965.51,Um the world around us in the context and Humanity better and and I think if you do that you become more compassionate and.,0.85,198
2,896,7965.525,7971.64,More understanding yourself and and more tolerant and all these I think all these other things may flow format and to me,0.8300000000000001,198
2,897,7971.592,7978.922,you know understanding the nature of reality that is the biggest question what is going on here is sometimes the colloquial way I say what is really going on here.,0.88,198
2,898,7979.145,7982.703,It's so mysterious and I feel like we're in some huge puzzle.,0.77,199
2,899,7982.863,7991.679,And and it's but the world is also seems to be the universe seems to be structured in a way you know why is it structured in a way that science is even possible.,0.91,199
2,900,7991.712,8000.762,That you know methods the scientific method Works things are repeatable it feels like it's almost structured in a way to be conducive to gaining knowledge.,0.75,199
2,901,8000.868,8005.713,So I feel like and you know why should computers be even possible isn't that amazing that.,0.9,199
2,902,8005.801,8015.634,Computational electronic devices can can can can be possible and they're made of sand are most you know common element that we have you know silicon on the Earth's crust.,0.85,199
2,903,8015.793,8027.652,It could be made of diamond or something that we would have only had one computer yeah right so it's a lot of things are kind of slightly suspicious to me it sure as heck sounds this puzzle sure steak sounds like something we talked about earlier what it takes to,0.77,199
2,904,8027.568,8038.103,to design a game that's really fun to play for prolonged periods of time and it does seem like this puzzle like you mentioned the more you learn about it.,0.91,199
2,905,8038.118,8044.676,The more you realize how little you know so it humbles you but excites you by the possibility of learning more.,0.9,199
2,906,8044.861,8053.983,One heck of a one heck of a puzzle we got going on here so like I mentioned of all the people in the world you're very likely,0.87,200
2,907,8053.908,8059.394,to be the one who creates the AGI system that,0.85,200
2,908,8059.256,8074.121,achieves human level intelligence that goes beyond it so if you got a chance in very well you could be the person that goes into the room with the system and have a conversation maybe you only get to ask one question if you do what question would you ask her.,0.91,200
2,909,8075.28,8079.325,I would probably ask what is the true nature of reality.,0.81,201
2,910,8079.448,8087.877,I think that's the question I don't know if I don't understand the answer because maybe it would be 42 or something like that but that's the question I would ask,0.77,201
2,911,8087.847,8100.264,and then they'll be a deep sigh from the systems like I how do I explain to this human exactly all right let me I don't have time to explain maybe I'll draw you a picture that it is.,0.9,201
2,912,8100.423,8105.8,I mean how do you even begin to answer that question.,0.85,201
2,913,8107.121,8114.38,Well I think it would what would you what would you think the answer could possibly looks like I think it could it could start looking like.,0.85,202
2,914,8114.458,8128.531,More fundamental explanations of physics would be the beginning you know more careful specification at that taking you walking us through by the hand as to what one would do to maybe prove those things out maybe giving you glimpses of.,0.84,202
2,915,8128.934,8137.858,What things you totally missed in the physics of today exactly just here's glimpses of know like there's a much.,0.87,203
2,916,8138.071,8142.422,How much more elaborate world are much simpler world of something.,0.76,203
2,917,8142.599,8152.234,Much deeper maybe simpler explanation yes of things right then the standard model of physics which we know doesn't work but we still keep adding to so,0.8,203
2,918,8152.096,8161.894,and and that's how I think the beginning of an explanation would look and it would start encompassing many of the Mysteries that we have wondered about for thousands of years like you know Consciousness dreaming,0.81,203
2,919,8161.738,8169.78,life and gravity all of these things you're giving us a glimpse of explanations for those things yeah well,0.91,203
2,920,8169.723,8172.111,Devon still one of the special.,0.7000000000000001,203
2,921,8172.342,8184.166,Human beings in this giant puzzle of ours and it's a huge honor that you would take a pause from the bigger puzzle to solve the small puzzle of a conversation with me today it's truly an honor and a pleasure thanks when you're really enjoyed it thanks Lex.,0.81,203
2,922,8184.954,8191.394,Thanks for listening to this conversation with damage that's obvious the support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description.,0.81,204
