## About the Project

During the [Sound of AI Hackathon](https://musikalkemist.github.io/thesoundofaihackathon/) we set out to build an AI-powered search engine for content in podcasts. This is the working prototype and demo.

## Demo

### Main Search Window
<div align="center">
  <img src="./app/static/img/front_UI.png" width = "100%" height = "100%">
</div>

### Result Window
<div align="center">
  <img src="./app/static/img/render_UI.png" width = "100%" height = "100%">
</div>


## Getting Started
