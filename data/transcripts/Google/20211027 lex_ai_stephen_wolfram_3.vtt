00:00:00.017 --> 00:00:08.918
The following is a conversation with Stephen Wolfram his third time on the podcast he's a computer scientist mathematician theoretical physicist.

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:18.145
And the founder of Wolfram research a company behind Mathematica Wolfram Alpha Wolfram language and the new Wolfram physics.

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:22.718
This conversation is a wild technical roller coaster ride.

00:00:22.778 --> 00:00:32.360
The topics of complexity mathematics physics Computing and Consciousness I urge you to come along for this wild ride and hold on.

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:37.554
Like the title and the lyrics of the beautiful Tom Waits song says hold on.

00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:51.768
I think this is what this podcast is becoming a wild ride some episodes are about physics some about robots some are about war and power some are about the human condition and our search for meaning,

00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:56.783
and some are just what the comedian Tim Dylan calls fun.

00:00:57.455 --> 00:01:10.439
And now a quick few seconds summary of the sponsors check them out in the description as the best way to support this podcast first is Roca my favorite sunglasses and prescription glasses second is fight camp

00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:15.165
a punching bag I use at home for boxing workout third is on it

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:29.983
and nutrition supplement and Fitness Company fourth is indeed a hiring website and fifth is fun dries a platform for investing in private real estate so the choices sunglasses boxing nutrition,

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:37.419
hiring or wealth she's wise in my friends and now on to the full ad reads as always no as in the middle

00:01:37.353 --> 00:01:45.512
I do try to make these interesting but if you skip them please do check out the sponsors in the description I enjoy their stuff maybe you will too.

00:01:46.355 --> 00:01:48.978
This show is brought to you by Roka

00:01:48.750 --> 00:02:04.372
the makers of glasses and sunglasses that I love wearing for their design feel and Innovation on material Optics and grip Roca was started by two All-American swimmers from Stanford and it was born out of an obsession with performance,

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:12.681
I say all that because it's always nice to know there's great human beings behind the product and this is one heck of a well-engineered product

00:02:12.534 --> 00:02:25.905
is designed to be active in it's extremely lightweight the grip is comfortable but strong in the style is classy minimalist and classy just how I like it so it holds up in all conditions when I'm wearing a suit

00:02:25.758 --> 00:02:35.403
or when I'm wearing running gear including on long runs in 100-degree Austin weather luckily the Summer's over so we're not hitting hundred degrees like we used to.

This shows also brought to you by a new sponsor called fight Camp it's a free-standing punching bag I use and you can use as well at home to get a great boxing workout in

00:02:57.716 --> 00:03:01.590
hitting this bag is one of my favorite high intensity full body workouts

00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:11.268
when I first heard about fight Camp one of my concern was if I hit this thing hard and fast and often is it going to move a lot I'm here to report that the thing doesn't move

00:03:11.112 --> 00:03:20.306
they have a separate part that goes on the floor the bag moves when you hit it so it gives you a great response but it doesn't sort of Hop

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:25.905
on the floor as you would expect so I can hit it as hard as I want it stays in one place gives me an amazing workout

00:03:25.821 --> 00:03:38.680
I love it if I came use this new tech that tracks each punch you throw to measure speed volume and output so you can follow your progress push yourself to compete on the community leader board and challenge others or

00:03:38.623 --> 00:03:50.590

00:04:05.782 --> 00:04:16.255
maybe you've heard of it it's nootropic that helps support memory mental speed and focus I don't take it every day I take it when I have a particularly,

00:04:16.261 --> 00:04:17.416
difficult

00:04:17.278 --> 00:04:29.533
deep work session when I have a session that I know is going to be two three four hours I'm going to have to go deep have to figure out a difficult problem this serves as a kind of boost as a catalyst as a launching pad

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:37.923
for the rocket of the mind I take it when I just need to clear the mind maintain focus on a difficult problem and it really does help me.

00:04:38.137 --> 00:04:45.611
Like I said I don't necessarily want to get psychologically dependent on it so I don't use it every day but I use it quite often.

00:04:45.987 --> 00:04:50.950
Because I actually have more and more of these deep work sessions

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:35.592
If you're looking to diversify your Investment Portfolio this is a good choice I know it might sound like old school advice

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:44.288
but I think with investment diversification is still super super powerful in this age of cryptocurrency and all kinds of investment tools

00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:50.356
it might be tempting to invest everything into one place I still believe in diversification not just

00:06:50.353 --> 00:06:58.899
would then a particular set of investment tools but across and I think private real estate is a super interesting place to diversify into,

00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:06.218
and of course it's nice to have a service like fund rise that makes that super easy reliable easy to monitor things easy too,

This is the Luxe Friedman podcast and here is my conversation with Stephen Wolfram.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:49.680
Music.

00:07:50.587 --> 00:08:01.051
Almost 20 years ago you published A New Kind of Science where you presented a study of complexity and an approach for modeling of complex systems so.

00:08:01.624 --> 00:08:08.153
Let Us return again to the core idea of complexity what is complexity.

00:08:08.403 --> 00:08:17.768
I don't know I think that's not the most interesting question it's like you know if you ask a biologist what is life yeah that's not the question they care the most about.

00:08:18.449 --> 00:08:21.405
What I was interested in is how does.

00:08:21.852 --> 00:08:33.207
Something that we would usually identifies complexity arise in nature and I got interested in that question like 50 years ago which is really embarrassingly long time ago and you know I was.

00:08:33.384 --> 00:08:47.232
You know how does snowflakes got to have complicated forms how the galaxies get to have complicated shapes how does you know how to living systems get produced things like that and the question is what's the sort of underlying scientific basis for those kinds of things.

00:08:47.454 --> 00:08:48.087
And.

00:08:48.157 --> 00:09:00.403
The thing that I was at first very surprised because I've been in doing physics and particle physics some fancy mathematical physics and so on it's like I know all this fancy stuff I should be able to solve this sort of basic science question.

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.644
And I couldn't this was Blake

00:09:02.623 --> 00:09:17.219
early maybe 1980s time frame and it's like okay what can one do to understand the sort of basic secret that nature seems to have because seems like nature you look around in the natural world that's full of incredibly complicated forms.

00:09:17.342 --> 00:09:18.263
You look at.

00:09:18.467 --> 00:09:31.640
Sort of most engineered kinds of things for instance they tend to be you know we got some sort of circles and lines and things like this the question is what secret does nature have that lets it make all this complexity,

00:09:31.683 --> 00:09:38.671
that we in doing engineering for example don't naturally seem to have and so that was the kind of the thing that I got interested in.

00:09:38.794 --> 00:09:44.955
And then the question was you know could I understand that with things like mathematical physics well didn't work very well.

00:09:45.024 --> 00:09:56.334
So then I got to thinking about okay is there some other way to try to understand this and then the question was if you're going to look at some system in nature how do you make a model for that system for what that system does.

00:09:56.394 --> 00:10:05.696
So you know model is some abstract representation of the system some formal representation system what are the what is the raw material that you can make that model out of

00:10:05.549 --> 00:10:10.503
and so what I realized was well actually programs are really good.

00:10:10.707 --> 00:10:22.998
Source of raw material for making models of things and you know in terms of my personal history the to me that seemed really obvious and the reason it seems really obvious is that because I just spent several years building.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:34.179
Big piece of software that was sort of a predecessor to mathematical most language then go that's MP symbolic manipulation program which was something that had this idea of starting from.

00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:44.334
These computational Primitives and building up everything one had to build up and so kind of the notion of well let's just try and make models by starting from computational Primitives and seeing what we can build up.

00:10:44.475 --> 00:10:48.925
That seemed like a totally obvious thing to do in in retrospect

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:59.124
it might not have been externally quite so obvious but it was obvious to me at the time given the path that I happened to have been on so you know so that got me into this question of let's use programs

00:10:59.023 --> 00:11:00.853
to model what happens in nature.

00:11:01.129 --> 00:11:11.124
And the question then is what what kind of programs and you know we're used to programs that you write for some particular purpose and two big long piece of code and it does some specific thing.

00:11:11.392 --> 00:11:21.198
What I got interested in was okay if you just go out into the sort of computational Universe of possible programs you say take the simplest program you can imagine what does it do.

00:11:21.573 --> 00:11:35.134
And so I started studying these things called cellular automata actually didn't know at first they were called cellular automata but I found that out subsequently but it's just a line of cells you know each one is Black or White and it's just some rule that says

00:11:35.095 --> 00:11:43.281
the color of this cell is determined by the color that had on previous step and its two Neighbours on previous step and I had initially thought.

00:11:43.395 --> 00:11:46.305
That's you know sufficiently simple setup.

00:11:46.537 --> 00:12:00.970
It's not going to do anything interesting it's always going to be simple no complexity simple rules simple Behavior okay but then I actually ran the computer experiment which is pretty easy to do I mean it probably took a few hours originally and

00:12:00.877 --> 00:12:04.418
the and the results were not what I expected at all.

00:12:04.496 --> 00:12:13.771
Now needless to say in the way that science actually works the results I got a lot of unexpected things which I thought was really interesting but the really strongest result

00:12:13.741 --> 00:12:26.410
which was already right there in the print outside made I didn't really understand for a couple more years so it was it was not you know the compressed version of the story is you run the experiment and you immediately see what's going on but

00:12:26.309 --> 00:12:31.335
I wasn't smart enough to do that so to speak but the big the big thing is,

00:12:31.341 --> 00:12:41.174
even with very simple rules of that type sort of the minimal tiniest program sort of the the one-line program or something it's possible to get

00:12:41.036 --> 00:12:51.518
very complicated behavior my favorite example is the single rule 30 which is a particular cellular automaton rule you just started off from one black cell and it makes this really complicated pattern.

00:12:51.812 --> 00:12:59.026
And so that for me was sort of a critical discovery that then kind of said.

00:12:59.221 --> 00:13:02.762
Playing back onto you know how does nature make complexity.

00:13:02.822 --> 00:13:15.266
I sort of realized that might be how it does it that might be kind of the secret that it's using is that in this kind of computational Universe of possible programs it's actually pretty easy to get programs where even though the program is simple.

00:13:15.434 --> 00:13:23.656
The behavior when you run the program is not simple at all and that was so for me that was the kind of the story of kind of

00:13:23.554 --> 00:13:37.132
how that that was sort of the indication that one who got an idea of what the sort of secret that nature uses to make complexity and that complexity how complexity can be made in other places now if you say what is complexity

00:13:37.039 --> 00:13:45.270
you know its complexity is it's not easy to tell what's going on that's the informal version of,

00:13:45.312 --> 00:13:53.651
what is complexity but there is something going on but it's a rule you know what right well know the rules can generate just randomness.

00:13:53.775 --> 00:13:56.586
Right now that's not obvious.

00:13:56.718 --> 00:14:08.235
In other words it's not all those that is not obvious at all and it wasn't what I expected it's not what people's intuition had been and husband for you know for a long time that is one might think you have a rule.

00:14:08.421 --> 00:14:09.639
You can tell.

00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:20.127
There's a rule behind it I mean it's just like you know the early you know robots in science fiction movies but you can tell it's a robot cause it does simple things.

00:14:20.313 --> 00:14:23.494
It runs out that isn't actually the right story

00:14:23.392 --> 00:14:32.955
but it's not obvious that isn't the right story because people assume simple rules simple behavior and that the sort of the key discovery about the computational universe is that isn't true

00:14:32.835 --> 00:14:43.758
and that Discovery goes very deep and relates to all kinds of things that I've spent years and years studying but you know that in the end the sort of the

00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:52.688
the water's complexity is well you can't easily tell what it's going to do you could just run the rule and see what happens but you can't just say oh,

00:14:52.703 --> 00:14:55.938
you know show me the rule great I know what's going to happen.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:07.938
And you know the key phenomenon around that is this thing I call computational irreducibility this fact that in the something like rule 30 you might say well what's it going to do after a million steps.

00:15:08.052 --> 00:15:15.545
Well you can run this for a million steps and just do what it does to find out but you can't compress that you can't reduce that.

00:15:15.614 --> 00:15:18.192
And say I'm going to be able to jump ahead and say

00:15:18.018 --> 00:15:35.557
is what's going to do after million steps but I don't have to go through anything like that computational effort by the way has anybody succeeded that you had a challenge a competition right for predicting the middle column of rule 30 anybody need anybody a number of people have sent things in and sort of people are picking away at it but it's hard

00:15:35.428 --> 00:15:44.667
I mean it's I've been I've been actually even proving that the center column of rule 30 doesn't repeat,

00:15:44.701 --> 00:15:54.012
that's something I think might be doable okay mathematically proven yes and so that's analogous to a similar kind of things like the digits of pi

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:08.523
which are also generated in this very deterministic way and so a question is how random of the digits of pi for example does every first of all the digits of pi ever repeat or we know they don't because was proved in the 1800's that Pi is not a rational number

00:16:08.484 --> 00:16:23.161
so that means only rational numbers have digit sequences that repeat so we know the digits of pi don't repeat so now the question is does you know 0 1 2 3 or whatever through all the digits base 10 or base two or however you work it out do they all occur with equal frequency

00:16:23.086 --> 00:16:30.480
nobody knows that's far away from what can be understood mathematically at this point and that's

00:16:30.333 --> 00:16:38.222
that's kind of but I'm even looking for Step 1 which is proved that the the center column doesn't repeat.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:46.864
And then prove other things about it like equal distribution of equal numbers of zeros and ones and those are things which I you know I kind of set up this little little

00:16:46.717 --> 00:16:53.922
prize thing because I thought those were not not too out of range those are things which are within.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:17:09.010
You know a modest amount of time it's conceivable that those could be done they're not they're not far away from what current mathematics might allow they'll require a bunch of cleverness and hopefully some interesting new ideas that you know will be useful other places.

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:17.211
But you start in 1980 with this idea before I think you realized you know this idea of programs.

00:17:17.316 --> 00:17:25.052
It is thought that there might be some kind of thermodynamic like Randomness and then complexity comes from a clever filter.

00:17:25.607 --> 00:17:35.296
That you kind of like I don't know spaghetti or something you you filter the randomness and outcomes complexity which is an interesting intuition.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:44.461
How do we know that's not actually what's happening so just because you write were then able to develop look you don't need this like.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:53.562
Incredible Randomness you can just have very simple predictable initial conditions and predictable rules and if from that emerge complexity.

00:17:53.685 --> 00:18:02.042
Still there might be some systems where it's filtering Randomness yeah the inputs well the point is.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:11.215
When you have quotes Randomness than the input that means there's all kinds of information in the input yeah and in a sense what you get out will be maybe just.

00:18:11.338 --> 00:18:18.516
Something close to what you put in like people are very in dynamical systems theory so the big error mathematics that developed

00:18:18.423 --> 00:18:30.867
from the early 1900's and really got big in the 1980s you know an example of what people study their lot and its popular version is chaos theory and example what people study a lot

00:18:30.738 --> 00:18:34.819
is the shift map which is basically taking 2X.

00:18:34.924 --> 00:18:42.795
Mod 12 at the fractional part of 2x which is basically just taking digits and binary and shifting them to the left so at every step,

00:18:42.846 --> 00:18:54.624
you got to see if you say how big is this number that I got out well the most important digit in that number is whatever ended up at the at the left-hand end but now if you start off from an arbitrary random number.

00:18:54.801 --> 00:19:01.583
Which is quotes randomly chosen so all its digits are random then when you run that sort of Chaos Theory shift map.

00:19:01.859 --> 00:19:04.950
All that you got out is just whatever you put in

00:19:04.929 --> 00:19:19.786
you just get to see what you what it's not obvious that you would excavate all of those digits and if you're for example making a theory I don't know fluid Mechanics for example if there was that phenomenon in fluid mechanics then the equations of fluid mechanics can't be right.

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:29.247
Because what that will be saying is the equations of that that it matters to the fluid what happens in the fluid at the level of the you know millionth digit.

00:19:29.424 --> 00:19:30.831
Of the initial conditions,

00:19:30.865 --> 00:19:40.770
Which is far below the points at which you're hitting kind of sizes of molecules and things like that so it's kind of almost explaining if that phenomenon is an important thing

00:19:40.749 --> 00:19:50.168
it's kind of telling you that the fluid dynamics which describes fluids as continuous media and so on isn't isn't really right but so you know so this idea that.

00:19:50.309 --> 00:19:59.053
You know there's there's it's a tricky thing because as soon as you put Randomness in you have to no you know what how much of what's coming out is what you put in

00:19:59.015 --> 00:20:06.345
versus how much is actually something that's being generated and what's really nice about these systems where you just have very simple initial conditions

00:20:06.207 --> 00:20:15.375
I'm where you get random stuff out or seemingly random stuff out is you don't have that issue you don't have to argue about was that something complicated put in.

00:20:15.444 --> 00:20:25.286
Because plainly obvious there wasn't now as a practical matter in doing experiments the big thing is if the thing you see is complex and reproducible.

00:20:25.589 --> 00:20:30.543
Then it didn't come from just filtering some quotes Randomness from the outside world.

00:20:30.676 --> 00:20:36.728
It has to be something that is intrinsically made because it wouldn't otherwise be I mean you know the.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:42.435
It could be the case that you set things up and it's always the same each time and you say well it's kind of,

00:20:42.442 --> 00:20:51.357
the same but it's not then it's not randomly each time because it's kind of the definition of it being random is it was kind of picked picked at random each time so to speak,

00:20:51.372 --> 00:20:57.181
so is it possible to for sure know that our universe does not at the fundamental

00:20:57.142 --> 00:21:04.167
level have Randomness is it possible to conclusively say there's no Randomness at the bottom

00:21:04.128 --> 00:21:07.309
well it's an interesting question I mean you know

00:21:07.243 --> 00:21:20.749
science Natural Sciences an inductive business right You observe a bunch of things and you say can we fit these together what is our hypothesis for what's going on the thing that I think I can say fairly definitively

00:21:20.638 --> 00:21:26.753
is this point we understand enough about fundamental physics that there is if.

00:21:26.814 --> 00:21:35.153
There was sort of an extra dice being thrown it's something that doesn't need to be there we can get what we see without that.

00:21:35.321 --> 00:21:43.255
Now you know could you add that in as an extra little feature roid you know without breaking the universe.

00:21:43.342 --> 00:21:47.000
Probably but in fact almost certainly yes.

00:21:47.114 --> 00:21:54.148
But is it necessary for understanding Universe know and I think actually from a more fundamental point of view it's.

00:21:54.298 --> 00:22:05.598
It's I think I might be able to argue so one of the things that I've been interested in a pretty surprised that I've had anything sent in to say about is the question of why does the universe exist

00:22:05.568 --> 00:22:08.668
I didn't think that was a question that I would you know

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:16.599
I thought that was a far out their metaphysical kind of thing even the Philosopher's of stayed away from that question for the most part,

00:22:16.614 --> 00:22:25.808
it's so such a kind of you know difficult to address question but I actually think to my great surprise that from a physics project and so on

00:22:25.716 --> 00:22:38.574
but it is possible to actually address that question and explain why the universe exists and I kind of have a suspicion I've not thought it through I kind of have a suspicion that that explanation will eventually show you that.

00:22:38.778 --> 00:22:44.587
In no meaningful sense can there be Randomness underneath universe that is that if there is.

00:22:44.728 --> 00:22:53.779
It's something that is necessarily irrelevant to our perception of the universe that is that it could be there but doesn't matter.

00:22:53.884 --> 00:23:03.357
Because in a sense we've already you know whatever it would do whatever extra thing it would add is not relevant to our perception of what's going on so why.

00:23:03.606 --> 00:23:18.391
Does the universe exist how does the irrelevance of Randomness connect to the big why question of so verse okay so I mean why does the universe exist well let's see and is this the only Universe we got.

00:23:18.523 --> 00:23:19.579
It's the only one.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:32.353
That about that I'm pretty sure so now maybe which one which of these topics is better to enter first why does the universe exists and why you think it's the only one that exists.

00:23:32.512 --> 00:23:40.365
Well I think they're very closely related okay okay so I mean the first thing let's see I mean this why does the universe exist question.

00:23:40.596 --> 00:23:52.104
Is built on top of all these things that we've been figuring out about fundamental physics because if you want to know why the universe exists you kind of have to know what the universe is made of and I think

00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:56.425
the well let me let me describe a little bit about

00:23:56.332 --> 00:24:03.456
the why does the universe exist question so the main issue is let's say you have a model for the universe and you say I've got this.

00:24:03.642 --> 00:24:06.562
Program or something and you run it and you make the universe.

00:24:06.784 --> 00:24:14.736
Now you say well how do you actually why is that program actually running and people say you've got this program that makes the universe what computer is it running on.

00:24:15.615 --> 00:24:27.312
What does it mean what actualize has something you know two plus two equals four but that's different from saying this to a pile of to rocks and other part of two rocks and some of them moves them together and makes for so to speak

00:24:27.228 --> 00:24:34.946
and so what is it that kind of turns it from being just this formal thing to being something that is actualized

00:24:34.943 --> 00:24:44.236
okay so that we have to start thinking about well well what do we actually know about what's going on in the universe well we are observers of this universe.

00:24:44.431 --> 00:24:48.395
But confusingly enough with part of this universe so in a sense

00:24:48.392 --> 00:25:03.078
we what what what if we say what do we what do we know about what's going on in the universe well what we know is what sort of our Consciousness records about what's going on in the universe and so Consciousness is part of the fabric of the universe so we're in it,

00:25:03.084 --> 00:25:08.074
yes we're in it and and maybe I should maybe I should start off by saying something about.

00:25:08.188 --> 00:25:13.935
The Consciousness story because that that's some uh maybe we should begin.

00:25:14.193 --> 00:25:23.180
Even before that at the very base layer of the Wolfram physics project maybe you can give a broad overview once again.

00:25:23.456 --> 00:25:27.645
Really quick about this hypergraph model yes and also

00:25:27.489 --> 00:25:41.374
what is it a year and a half ago since you've brought this project to the world what is the status update where what are all the beautiful ideas you have come across what are the interesting things you can do it mentioned its,

00:25:41.398 --> 00:25:49.971
I mean it's a it's a freaking Cambrian explosion I mean it's it's crazy I mean they're all these things which I've kind of wondered about for years

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:59.396
and suddenly there's actually way to think about them and I really did not see I mean the real strength of what's happened I absolutely did not see coming

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:12.675
and the real strength of it is we've got this model for physics but it turns out it's a foundational kind of model that's a different kind of computation like model that I'm kind of calling the sort of multi computational model and

00:26:12.627 --> 00:26:18.994
that's that kind of model is applicable not only to physics but also to lots of other kinds of things,

00:26:19.018 --> 00:26:24.891
and one reason that's extremely powerful is because physics has been very successful so we know a lot.

00:26:24.978 --> 00:26:33.722
Based on what we figured out in physics and if we know that the same model governs physics and governs I don't know economics Linguistics Immunology whatever.

00:26:33.953 --> 00:26:43.507
We know that the same kind of model governs those things we can start using things that we've successfully discovered in physics and applying those intuitions and all these other areas.

00:26:43.622 --> 00:26:51.078
And that's that's pretty exciting and very surprising to me and in fact it's kind of like in the original story of,

00:26:51.120 --> 00:27:00.126
sort of you go and you explain why is that complexity in the natural world then you realize well there's all this complexity there's all this computational irreducibility

00:26:59.979 --> 00:27:14.457
you know there's a lot we can't know about what's going to happen it's kind of kind of very confusing thing for people who say you know science is nailed everything down we're going to you know based on science we can know everything well actually there's this computational irreducibility thing right in the middle of that.

00:27:14.661 --> 00:27:19.984
Throwing up by science so to speak and then the question is well given computational irreducibility.

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:27.582
How can we actually figure out anything about what happens in the world why aren't we why are we able to predict anything why are we able to operate in the world.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:35.955
And the answer is that we sort of live in these slices of computational reusability that exist in this kind of ocean of computational irreducibility.

00:27:36.087 --> 00:27:43.552
And it turns out that seems that it's a very fundamental feature of the kind of model that seems to operate in physics.

00:27:43.766 --> 00:27:52.996
And perhaps in the lab all of these other areas that there are these particular slices of computational reducibility that are relevant to us and.

00:27:53.056 --> 00:28:05.941
Those are the things that both allow us to operate in the world and not just have everything be completely unpredictable but they're also things that potentially give us what amount to sort of physics like laws in all these other areas,

00:28:05.974 --> 00:28:11.153
so that's that's been sort of an exciting thing but but I would say that in general for our project.

00:28:11.385 --> 00:28:23.612
It's been going spectacularly well I mean I you know I it's very honestly it wasn't something I expected to happen in my lifetime I mean it's you know it's something where where it's it's an in fact.

00:28:23.709 --> 00:28:32.777
One of the things about it some of the things that we've discovered are things where I was pretty sure that wasn't how things worked and turns out I'm wrong.

00:28:32.855 --> 00:28:45.398
You know I've been a major area in metamathematics I'd be realizing that I've something I've long believed we can talk about it later that that just just really isn't right but I think that.

00:28:45.845 --> 00:28:59.235
The the thing that so what's happened with the physics project I mean you know it's a can explain a little bit about how the how the model works but basically working maybe ask you the following question so.

00:28:59.304 --> 00:29:04.717
It's easy through words describe how cellular am Works you've explained this

00:29:04.696 --> 00:29:16.492
and it's the fundamental mechanism by which you in your book and you kind of science explored the idea of complexity and how to do science in this world of

00:29:16.354 --> 00:29:24.252
I'll reducible islands and irreducible general irreducibility okay so how does the model of

00:29:24.249 --> 00:29:29.140
hypergraphs differ from cellular automata and how does they deal multi computation.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:35.208
Different like maybe that's a way to describe it we're right this is a you know

00:29:35.079 --> 00:29:49.656
my life is like all of our Lives something of a story of computational irreducibility yes and you know it's been going for a few years now so it's always a challenge to kind of find these appropriate pockets of reduced ability but let me see what I can do so

00:29:49.581 --> 00:29:57.155
so I mean first of all let's talk about physics first of all and you know a key observation.

00:29:57.341 --> 00:30:04.267
The one of the starting point of our physics project is things about what is space what is the universe made of.

00:30:04.741 --> 00:30:11.289
And you know ever since Euclid people just sort of say space is just this thing where you can put things at any position you want

00:30:11.214 --> 00:30:23.262
and they're just points and they just geometrical things that you can just arbitrarily put it different different coordinate positions so does the first thing in our physics project is the idea that space is made of something.

00:30:23.412 --> 00:30:27.745
Just like water is made of molecules space is made of kind of atoms of space.

00:30:28.048 --> 00:30:35.883
And the only thing we can say about these atoms of space says they have some identity there's a there's a there is it's this Adam as opposed to this Adam.

00:30:36.024 --> 00:30:46.902
And you know you could give them a few a computer person you give them uuids or something damn it yes and but that's all there is to say about them say yes speak um and then.

00:30:47.313 --> 00:30:57.191
All we know about these atoms of space is how they relate to each other so we say these three atoms of space are

00:30:57.116 --> 00:31:08.354
associated with each other in some relation so you can think about that as you know what Adam of spaces friends with what other atom of space you can build this essentially friend network of the atoms of space

00:31:08.225 --> 00:31:09.443
and

00:31:09.323 --> 00:31:21.731
the sort of starting point of our physics project is that's what I universe is it's a giant friend network of the atoms of space and so how can that possibly represent our universe well it's like

00:31:21.648 --> 00:31:26.872
in something like water you know their molecules bouncing around but on a large scale

00:31:26.851 --> 00:31:36.216
that you know that produces fluid flow and we have fluid vortices and we have all of these phenomena that are sort of the emergent phenomena from that underlying,

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:49.773
kind of collection of molecules bouncing around and by the way it's important that collection of molecules bouncing around have this phenomenon of computational irreducibility that's actually what leads to the second law of Thermodynamics among other things and that

00:31:49.609 --> 00:31:52.762
leads to the sort of randomness of the underlying Behavior

00:31:52.723 --> 00:32:05.023
which is what gives you something which on a large scale seems like it's a smooth continuous type of thing and so so okay so first thing is space is made of something it's made of

00:32:04.957 --> 00:32:11.406
all these atoms of space connected together in this network and then everything that we experience.

00:32:11.547 --> 00:32:19.256
Is sort of features of the of that structure of space so you know when we have an electron or something or a photon it's some kind of tangle

00:32:19.127 --> 00:32:22.344
and the structure of space much like kind of a Vortex and a fluid.

00:32:22.413 --> 00:32:30.041
Would be just this thing that is you know it can actually be the vortex can move around it can involve different molecules in the fluid

00:32:29.876 --> 00:32:39.034
but the vortex still stays there and this is Ahmad enough The Vortex looks like an atom itself like a basic column yes so there's the levels of abstraction

00:32:38.941 --> 00:32:47.352
if you squint as kind of blur things out it looks like at every level of abstraction you can Define what is a basic.

00:32:47.718 --> 00:32:51.529
Individual entity yes but you know in this model.

00:32:51.616 --> 00:33:04.168
There's a bottom level yeah you know there's an elementary length maybe that sends us a hundred ten to the minus 100 meters let's say which is really small you know proton is 10 to the minus 15 meters the smallest we've ever been able to sort of

00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:09.210
see where the particle accelerator is our intent of - 21 meters so you know if,

00:33:09.261 --> 00:33:23.865
we don't know precisely what the correct scale is but it's perhaps of the order of 10 to the minus 100 meters so it's pretty small and but that's that's the end that's that's what things are made of what's your intuition where the 10 to the minus 100 comes from.

00:33:24.024 --> 00:33:30.095
What's your intuition about the scale well okay so there's a calculation which I consider to be somewhat rickety.

00:33:30.236 --> 00:33:39.790
Okay which has to do with comparing so so there are various fundamental constants there's a speed of light the speed of light once you know the elementary time.

00:33:39.886 --> 00:33:48.693
The speed of light is tells you the conversion from the elementary time to the elementary length then there's the question of how do you convert to the elementary energy.

00:33:48.799 --> 00:34:01.297
And how do you convert to between other things and their various constants we know we know the speed of light we know the gravitational constant we know Planck's Constant and quantum mechanics those are the three important ones and

00:34:01.222 --> 00:34:10.650
we actually know some other things we know things like the size of the universe the Hubble constant things like that and essentially this calculation of the elementary length.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:21.714
Comes from looking at these sort of combination of those okay so the most obvious thing people have sort of assumed that quantum gravity happens at this thing the Planck scale to the minus 34 meters.

00:34:21.837 --> 00:34:34.236
Which is the sort of the combination of Planck's Constant and the gravitational constant speed of light that gives you that kind of length turns out in our model there is an additional parameter.

00:34:34.395 --> 00:34:43.985
Which is essentially the number of simultaneous threads of execution of the universe which is essentially the number of sort of independent Quantum processes that are going on.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:52.682
And that number see if I remember that number that number is 10 to the 170 I think in and so it's a big number but that number.

00:34:52.832 --> 00:34:58.209
Then connects you know sort of modifies what you might think from all these plank.

00:34:58.386 --> 00:35:09.165
Units to give you the things with giving and that there's been sort of a mystery actually in the in the is more technical physics thing that the Planck Mass the Planck energy.

00:35:09.234 --> 00:35:12.019
Planck energy is actually surprisingly big

00:35:11.971 --> 00:35:24.874
the Planck length is Tiny it undermines 34 meters that you know Planck time to the minus 43 M I think that seconds I think but the Planck energy is like is like the the energy of a lightning strike.

00:35:25.033 --> 00:35:27.871
Okay which is pretty weird and our models.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:42.023
The actual Elementary energy is that divided by the number of simultaneous Quantum threads and it ends up being really small to and that sort of explains that mystery that's been around for a while about about how Planck units work.

00:35:42.272 --> 00:35:44.130
But that you know whether that.

00:35:44.244 --> 00:35:58.596
Precise estimate is right we don't know yet I mean that that that's one of the things that sort of been a thing we've been pretty interested in is how do you see through you know how does you how do you make a gravitational microscope that can kind of see through to the atoms of space.

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:06.833
How do you get in in fluid flow for example if you go to Hypersonic flow or something you know you've got a mock 20 you know space plane or something

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.669
it really matters that there are individual molecules,

00:36:09.684 --> 00:36:17.456
hitting the space plane not a continuous fluid the question is what is the analogous kind of what is the analog of hypersonic flow,

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:23.901
for for our first things about the structure of space-time and it looks like a

00:36:23.872 --> 00:36:37.495
a rapidly rotating black hole right at this sort of critical rotation rate is it looks as if that's a case where essentially the the structure of space-time is just about to fall apart.

00:36:37.744 --> 00:36:47.082
And you may be able to kind of see the evidence of sort of discrete elements you know you may be able to kind of see there

00:36:47.071 --> 00:36:58.578
these sort of gravitational microscope of actually seeing these discrete elements of space and there may be some effect in for example gravitational waves produced by rapidly rotating black hole

00:36:58.476 --> 00:37:08.652
that in which one could actually see some phenomenon where one can say yes these don't come out the way one would expect based on having a continuous structure of space-time.

00:37:08.757 --> 00:37:12.397
They do is it something where you can kind of see through to the discrete structure.

00:37:12.565 --> 00:37:24.037
We don't know that yet so you maybe elaborate a little bit deeper how a microscope they can see to 10 to the minus 100 how rotating black holes.

00:37:24.367 --> 00:37:35.308
And presumably the the detailed accurate detection of gravitational waves from such black holes can reveal the discreteness of space.

00:37:35.728 --> 00:37:37.999
Okay first thing is what is a black hole

00:37:37.789 --> 00:37:53.834
actually we need to go a little bit further in the story of what space-time is because I explain a little bit about what space is but it didn't talk about what time is and that's sort of important in understanding space-time so it's been and your senses both space and time in this story are discrete absolutely.

00:37:54.065 --> 00:38:00.073
Absolutely but it's a complicated story yes and needless to say or simple at the bottom.

00:38:00.133 --> 00:38:04.475
It's very simple at the bottom it's very in the end,

00:38:04.508 --> 00:38:14.503
it's simple but deeply abstract and on something that is simple and conception but kind of wrapping one's head around what's going on is

00:38:14.438 --> 00:38:29.249
pretty hard but so so first of all we have this so now I've described this kind of atoms of space in their connections you can think about these things as a hyper graph you know a graph is just you connect nodes to nodes but a hyper graph you can have you know

00:38:29.066 --> 00:38:37.549
you can have sort of not just friends individual friends to friends but you can have these Triplets of friends or whatever else it's some

00:38:37.375 --> 00:38:41.843
and so we just saying that that's just the relations between atoms of space

00:38:41.822 --> 00:38:55.004
all the hyper edges of the hypergraph and so we got some big collection of these atoms of space maybe ten to the four hundred or something in our in our universe and that's the structure of space that's an every feature

00:38:54.903 --> 00:38:59.335
of what we experience and the world is a feature of that

00:38:59.323 --> 00:39:08.553
that hypergraph that special hypergraph so then the question is well how does what does that special hypergraph do well the idea is that there are rules.

00:39:08.604 --> 00:39:16.529
That update that special hypergraph and you know in a cellular automaton you've just got this line of cells and you just say it every step

00:39:16.517 --> 00:39:29.240
every time step you got fixed time steps fixed array of cells at every step every cell gets updated according to a certain Rule and that's that's kind of the that's the way it works now in this hyper graph it's

00:39:29.147 --> 00:39:35.425
sort of vaguely the same kind of thing we say every time you see a little piece of hyper graph that looks like this.

00:39:35.611 --> 00:39:44.724
Update it to one that looks like this so it's just keep rewriting the type of graph every time you see something looks like that anywhere in the universe it gets Rewritten.

00:39:44.883 --> 00:39:58.533
Now one thing that's tricky about that which will come to us that's multi computational idea which has to do with you're not saying in some kind of lockstep way do this one then this one then this one it's just whenever you see one you can do.

00:39:58.621 --> 00:40:03.872
You can go ahead and do it and that leads one not to have a single thread of time in the universe.

00:40:04.139 --> 00:40:11.992
Because if you knew which one to do you just say okay we do this one then we do this one then we do this one but if you say just do whichever one you feel like.

00:40:12.115 --> 00:40:22.642
You end up with these multiple threads of time this kind of multiple histories of the universe depending on which order you happen to do the things you could do in so it's fundamentally a synchronous and parallel.

00:40:22.738 --> 00:40:30.555
Yes yes which is very uncomfortable for the human brain that seeks for things to be sequential yeah and synchronous.

00:40:31.119 --> 00:40:36.586
Well I think that this is this is part of the story of Consciousness as I think,

00:40:36.637 --> 00:40:45.057
the key aspect of Consciousness that is important for sort of parsing the universe is this point that we have a single thread of experience

00:40:44.937 --> 00:40:58.390
we have a memory of what happened in the past we can say something predict something about the future but there's a single thread of experience and it's not obvious it should work that way I mean we've got a hundred billion neurons in our brains and they're all firing and all kinds of different ways but yet.

00:40:58.468 --> 00:41:06.762
Our experiences that there is the single thread of time that that goes that goes along and I think that.

00:41:06.822 --> 00:41:16.205
You know one of the things I've kind of realized with a lot more clarity in the last year is the fact that our the fact that we conclude that the Universe has the laws it has.

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:23.677
As a consequence of the fact that we have Consciousness the way we have Consciousness and so the fact so it's I mean just

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:37.423
to go on with kind of the the basic setup it's so we got this special hypergraph it's got all these atoms of space they're getting they're getting these little clumps of atoms of space so getting turned into other types of atoms a space that's happening everywhere in the universe all the time.

00:41:37.484 --> 00:41:39.593
And so one thing is a little bit weird is,

00:41:39.635 --> 00:41:49.504
there's nothing permanent in the universe the universe is getting Rewritten everywhere all the time and if it wasn't getting Rewritten it would space wouldn't be knitted together that is space would just fall apart

00:41:49.403 --> 00:42:03.107
there wouldn't be any way in which we could say this part of space is next to this part of space you know one of the things that I was people were confused about back in Antiquity you know the ancient Greek philosophers and so honest how does motion work.

00:42:03.527 --> 00:42:13.496
You know how can it be the case that you can take a thing that we can walk around and it's still us when we walked you know a foot forward so to speak and in a sense with our models

00:42:13.457 --> 00:42:15.260
that's again a question

00:42:15.248 --> 00:42:25.406
because it's a different set of atoms of space when we went you know when I move my hand it's moving into a different set of atoms of space it's having to be recreated it's not,

00:42:25.439 --> 00:42:34.507
the thing itself is not there it's being continuously recreated all the time now it's a little bit like waves in an ocean you know vortices in a fluid which again

00:42:34.387 --> 00:42:45.238
the actual molecules that exist in those are not what define the identity of the thing and but it's a little bit you know this idea that there can be pure motion.

00:42:45.316 --> 00:42:54.555
That it can that it is even possible for an object to just move around in the universe and not change is it's not self-evident that such a thing should be possible.

00:42:54.786 --> 00:43:02.990
And that is part of our perception of the universe is that we we parse those aspects of the universe where things like pure motion impossible.

00:43:03.095 --> 00:43:06.870
Now pure motion even in general tivity the theory of gravity.

00:43:06.993 --> 00:43:14.738
Pure motion is a little bit of a complicated thing I mean if you imagine your average you know tea cup or something approaching a black hole,

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:27.521
it is deformed and distorted by the structure of space-time and to say is it really pure motion is it that same teacup that's the same shape well it's a bit of a complicated story and this is a more extreme version of that.

00:43:27.698 --> 00:43:35.731
So so anyway the thing that that's happening as we got space we've got this notion of time so time is this kind of,

00:43:35.774 --> 00:43:43.987
this rewriting of the hypergraph and one of the things that's important about that time is this sort of computational irreducible process that something

00:43:43.975 --> 00:43:46.183
you know time is not something

00:43:46.144 --> 00:43:59.983
and it's kind of the mathematical view of time tends to be time is just to coordinate we can you know slider slider turn a knob and we'll change the time that we've got in this equation but in this picture of time

00:43:59.891 --> 00:44:09.553
that's not how it works at all time is this inexorable irreducible kind of set of computations that go on that go from where we are now to the Future.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:15.305
But so so the thing on one of the things that is again something once it has to break out of

00:44:15.302 --> 00:44:27.035
is your average trained physicist like me says you know space and time of the same kind of thing they're related by you know the prank or a group and and lorentz Transformations and relativity and all these kinds of things.

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:34.615
And you know space and time you know they're all these kind of sort of folk stories you can tell about why space and time the same kind of thing.

00:44:34.945 --> 00:44:37.766
In this model the fundamentally not the same kind of thing

00:44:37.628 --> 00:44:50.099
spaces this kind of sort of connections between these atoms of space-time is this computational process so the thing that the first sort of surprising thing is well it turns out you get relativity anyway.

00:44:50.330 --> 00:45:01.073
And the reason that happens that few bits and pieces here which one has to understand but but the fundamental point is if you are an observer embedded in the system.

00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:06.249
That a part of this whole story of things getting updated in this way and that.

00:45:06.435 --> 00:45:15.738
There are the sort of a limit to what you can tell about what's going on and really in the end the only thing you can tell is what are the causal relationships between events.

00:45:15.879 --> 00:45:20.095
So an event in this sort of at the elementary event.

00:45:20.263 --> 00:45:27.369
Is a little piece of hypergraph got Rewritten and that means a few hyper edges of the hypergraph what consumed by the event.

00:45:27.726 --> 00:45:34.975
And you produce some other hyper edges and that's an elementary event and so then the question is what we can tell

00:45:34.946 --> 00:45:47.948
is kind of what the network of causal relationships between Elementary events has that's the ultimate thing the causal graph of the universe and it turns out that while there's this property of causal invariance.

00:45:48.053 --> 00:45:54.997
That is true of a bunch of these models and I think is inevitably true for a variety of reasons that

00:45:54.994 --> 00:46:06.384
makes it be the case that it doesn't matter kind of if you are sort of saying well I've got the type of graph and I can rewrite this piece here and this piece here and I do them all in different orders,

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:11.858
when you construct the causal graph for each of those orders that you choose to do things in.

00:46:12.017 --> 00:46:20.968
You'll end up with the same causal graph and so that's essentially why well that's in the end why relativity Works its why

00:46:20.965 --> 00:46:30.492
our perception of space and time is is as having this kind of connection that relativity says they should have and that's that's kind of that's kind of how that works

00:46:30.345 --> 00:46:42.690
I think I'm missing a little piece is if we can go there again you said the fact that the Observer is embedded in this hyper graph what's missing what is the Observer not able

00:46:42.598 --> 00:46:51.540
the state about this universe so they sometimes look from the outside you can say oh I see this.

00:46:51.807 --> 00:46:59.876
I see this particular place was updated and then this one was updated and I'm seeing which order things were updated in.

00:46:59.972 --> 00:47:07.681
But the Observer embedded in the universe doesn't know which order things were updated in because until they've been updated they have no idea what else happened.

00:47:07.759 --> 00:47:11.489
So the only thing they know is the set of causal relationships,

00:47:11.531 --> 00:47:18.042
let me give an extreme example let's imagine that the universe is a turing machine Turing machines have just this one

00:47:18.022 --> 00:47:29.925
update head which does something and otherwise the term machine just does nothing right and and the turing machine works by having this head move around and do its updating you know just where the head happens to be.

00:47:30.112 --> 00:47:43.339
The question is could the universe be a turing machine could the universe just have a single updating head that just zipping around all over the place you say that's crazy because you know I'm talking to you you seem to be updating I'm updating Etc

00:47:43.327 --> 00:47:49.586
but the thing is there's no way to know that because if there was just this head moving around it's like okay it updates me.

00:47:49.673 --> 00:47:56.023
But you're completely Frozen at that point until the headers come over and updated you you have no idea what happened to me.

00:47:56.308 --> 00:48:06.231
And so if you sort of unravel that argument you realized the only thing we actually can tell is what the network of causal relationships between the things that happen were,

00:48:06.274 --> 00:48:13.289
we don't get to know from some sort of outside sort of God's eye view of the thing we don't get to know.

00:48:13.385 --> 00:48:27.117
What sort of from the outside what happened we only get to know sort of what the set of relationships between the things that happened actually work yeah but if I somehow record like a trace of this,

00:48:27.159 --> 00:48:31.951
I guess we'll be called multi computation can't I didn't look back.

00:48:33.316 --> 00:48:39.441
In the way you look forward to trace some you place throughout the Universe like throughout.

00:48:39.924 --> 00:48:46.120
Like a log that records in my own pocket of in this hypergraph can't I.

00:48:46.496 --> 00:48:52.503
Like realizing that I'm getting outdated picture can't I record.

00:48:52.563 --> 00:49:04.467
See the problem is and this is where things start getting very entangled in terms of what one understands the problem is that any such recording device is itself part of the universe yeah.

00:49:04.626 --> 00:49:10.111
So you don't get to say you never got to say let's go outside the universe and go do this.

00:49:10.451 --> 00:49:18.673
And that's why I mean lots of the features of this of this model and the way things work end up being a result of that so but why.

00:49:18.769 --> 00:49:32.455
I guess from on a human level what is the cost you're paying what are you missing from not getting an updated picture all the time okay I got I understand what you're saying oh yeah right like what like how does Consciousness emerge from that.

00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:41.790
How like what are the limitations to that Observer I understand you're getting a delay well that's that's okay this is this does.

00:49:41.905 --> 00:49:44.248
Bunch of limitations of the Observer I think.

00:49:44.362 --> 00:49:57.841
Maybe just explain something about quantum mechanics because that maybe as an extreme version of some of these issues which helps to kind of motivate why one should sort of think things through a little bit more carefully so one feature of the of this.

00:49:57.929 --> 00:50:04.647
Okay so in standard physics like high school physics you learn you know the equations of motion for a ball.

00:50:04.861 --> 00:50:12.452
And the the you know it says you throw the ball this angle this velocity things will move in this way and there's a definite answer.

00:50:12.792 --> 00:50:22.058
But the story the key story of quantum mechanics is there aren't definite answers to where does the ball go there's kind of this whole sort of bundle of possible paths

00:50:22.001 --> 00:50:28.296
and all we say we know from quantum mechanics is certain probabilities for where the ball will end up.

00:50:28.591 --> 00:50:32.923
Okay so that's kind of the core idea of quantum mechanics so in our models,

00:50:32.957 --> 00:50:42.430
you quantum mechanics is not some kind of plug-in add-on type thing you absolutely cannot get away from quantum mechanics because as you think about updating this hypergraph,

00:50:42.445 --> 00:50:55.051
there isn't just one sequence of things one definite sequence of things that can happen there are all these different possible updates sequences that can occur you could do this you know piece of the hypergraph now and then this one later and etc etc etc.

00:50:55.147 --> 00:50:59.714
All those different parts of History correspond to these Quantum quantum

00:50:59.693 --> 00:51:12.948
pause and quantum mechanics these different possible Quantum histories and one of the things that's kind of surprising about it is they they Branch you know there can be a certain state of the universe and it could do this or it could do that

00:51:12.909 --> 00:51:17.881
but they can also merge they can be two states of the universe which the next state.

00:51:17.968 --> 00:51:25.659
The next state they produces the same for both of them yeah and that process of branching and merging is kind of critical on the idea that there could be merging

00:51:25.566 --> 00:51:40.540
is critical and somewhat non-trivial for these hyper graphs because there's a whole graph isomorphism Story and there's a whole very elaborate setups for that cause 0 and variance comes in yes I'm honored among other things right yes that's but so so then what happens is.

00:51:40.645 --> 00:51:50.487
That what what one seeing Okay so we've got this thing that's branching and merging etc etc etc okay so now the question is how do we perceive that.

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:55.915
What are you know how do we do we why don't we notice that the universe is branching and merging.

00:51:56.273 --> 00:52:06.106
Why you know why is it the case that we just think a definite set of things happen well the answer is we are embedded in that universe and our brains are branching and merging two,

00:52:06.148 --> 00:52:11.120
and so what quantum mechanics becomes a story of is how does a branching brain

00:52:11.117 --> 00:52:23.471
the Seaver branching universe and the key thing is as soon as you say I think definite things happen in the universe that means you are essentially conflating lots of different parts of History.

00:52:23.549 --> 00:52:32.060
You're saying actually as far as I'm concerned because I'm convinced that definite things happen in the universe all these PODS of History must be equivalent.

00:52:32.237 --> 00:52:37.965
Now it's not obvious that that would be a consistent thing to do it might be you say all these positive history are equivalent.

00:52:38.313 --> 00:52:47.237
By golly moments later that would be a completely inconsistent point of view everything would have you know gone to hell in different ways the fact that that doesn't happen.

00:52:47.297 --> 00:53:02.289
Is well that's a consequence of this causal variants thing but that's and the fact that that does happen a little bit is what causes little Quantum effects and that term if that didn't happen at all there wouldn't be anything that sort of is like quantum mechanics,

00:53:02.295 --> 00:53:08.644
it would be quantum mechanics is kind of like in this in this kind of this bundle of paths,

00:53:08.669 --> 00:53:22.301
it's a little bit like what happens in statistical mechanics and fluid mechanics whatever that most of the time you just see this continuous fluid you just see the world just progressing in this kind of way that's like this continuous fluid but every so often if you look at the exact right experiment.

00:53:22.415 --> 00:53:33.068
You can start seeing well actually it's made of these molecules where they might go that way or they might go this way and that's kind of quantum effects and so that's so the this kind of idea,

00:53:33.119 --> 00:53:33.770
of

00:53:33.812 --> 00:53:46.571
we're sort of embedded in the universe this branching brain is perceiving this branching universe and that ends up being sort of a story of quantum mechanics that's that's part of the whole picture of what's going on but I think

00:53:46.442 --> 00:53:52.630
to come back to sort of where does conscious what is what is the story of Consciousness so in the universe.

00:53:53.230 --> 00:54:01.182
We've got you know whatever it is 10 to the 400 items of space they're all doing this complicated things it's all a big complicated irreducible computation.

00:54:01.359 --> 00:54:11.012
The question is what do we perceive from all of that and the answer is that we are we are parsing the universe in a particular way.

00:54:11.298 --> 00:54:21.185
Let me again go back to the gas molecules analogy you know in the gas in this room there are molecules bouncing around all kinds of complicated patterns but we don't care.

00:54:21.281 --> 00:54:29.584
All we notice is there's you know the gas laws are satisfied maybe there's some fluid dynamics these are kind of features,

00:54:29.599 --> 00:54:40.180
of that assembly of molecules that we notice and then lots of details we don't notice when you say we do you mean the tools of physics that you mean literally are the human brain and it's perception system.

00:54:40.573 --> 00:54:53.854
Well okay so the human brain is where it starts but we've built a bunch of instruments to do a bit better than human brain but they still have many of the same kinds of ideas you know their cameras and their pressure sensors and they're these kinds of things they're not

00:54:53.797 --> 00:54:56.303
you know this point we don't know

00:54:56.264 --> 00:55:08.006
how to make fundamentally qualitatively different sensory devices right and so it's always just an extension of the conscious experience for our sensory experience sensory experience but.

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:12.264
Sensory experience that somehow intricately tied to.

00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:23.300
Consciousness right well so one question is when we are looking at all these molecules that are in the gas and there might be 10 to 20 at molecules and some little little box or something it's like what,

00:55:23.334 --> 00:55:29.800
what do we notice about those molecules so one thing that we can say is we don't notice that much we are,

00:55:29.815 --> 00:55:44.690
you know we are computationally bounded observers we can't go in and say okay I'm that 10 to the 23rd molecules and I know that I can sort of decrypt emotions and I can figure out this and that it's like I'm just going to say what's the average density molecules.

00:55:44.813 --> 00:55:49.173
And so one key feature of us is that we are computationally bounded.

00:55:49.359 --> 00:55:58.193
And that when you are looking at a universe which is full of computation and doing huge amounts of computation but we are computationally bounded.

00:55:58.353 --> 00:56:01.722
There's only certain things about the universe that we're going to be sensitive to.

00:56:01.791 --> 00:56:13.821
We're not going to be you know figuring out what all the atoms are spaced so doing because we're just computationally bounded observers and we are only sampling these these small set of features,

00:56:13.881 --> 00:56:27.190
so I think the two defining features of Consciousness that and I you know I would say that the the sort of the preamble to the says for years you know as I've talked about sort of computation and fundamental features of physics and science.

00:56:27.367 --> 00:56:33.482
People ask me so what about Consciousness and I for years I've said I've nothing to say about consciousness.

00:56:33.641 --> 00:56:38.640
And you know I've kind of told the story you know you talk about intelligence you talk about life.

00:56:39.007 --> 00:56:46.193
These are both features where you say what's the abstract definition of life we don't really know the abstract definition we know the one for life on Earth.

00:56:46.308 --> 00:56:49.587
It's got our na it's got cell membranes it's got all this kind of stuff.

00:56:49.927 --> 00:56:56.447
Similarly for intelligence we know the human definition of intelligence but what is intelligence abstract you don't really know.

00:56:56.678 --> 00:57:03.955
And so what I've long believed is that sort of the abstract definition of intelligence is just computational sophistication.

00:57:04.132 --> 00:57:14.794
That is that as soon as you can be computationally sophisticated that's kind of the abstract version the generalized version of intelligence so then the question is what about consciousness.

00:57:14.881 --> 00:57:20.303
And what I sort of realized is that Consciousness is actually a step down from intelligence.

00:57:20.399 --> 00:57:28.594
That is that you might think oh you know Consciousness is the is the is the top of the pile but actually I don't think it is,

00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:37.587
I think that there's this notion of kind of computational sophistication which is the generalized intelligence but Consciousness has to limitations I think.

00:57:37.711 --> 00:57:39.820
One of them is computational boundedness.

00:57:40.024 --> 00:57:48.165
That is that we're only perceiving a sort of computational rebounded view of the universe and the other is this idea of a single thread of time.

00:57:48.414 --> 00:58:00.552
That is that we and in fact we know neurophysiological ER brains go to some trouble to give us this one thread of attention so to speak and it isn't the case that you know in all the neurons in our brains.

00:58:01.098 --> 00:58:07.385
That at least in our conscious note that the you know the correspondence of language in our conscious experience.

00:58:07.544 --> 00:58:16.648
We just have the single thread of attention single thread of perception and you know maybe there's something unconscious that's bubbling around that's the kind of,

00:58:16.699 --> 00:58:25.056
almost the quantum version of what's happening in our brain so to speak we've got the classical flow of what we are mostly thinking about so to speak,

00:58:25.063 --> 00:58:39.199
but does this kind of bubbling around of other pods that is all those other neurons that didn't make it to be part of our sort of conscious stream of experience so in that sense intelligence as computational sophistication is much broader

00:58:39.169 --> 00:58:44.942
then then the the computational constraints which.

00:58:45.345 --> 00:58:58.221
Consciousness operates under and also the sequential like the sequential thing yes like the notion of time as that's kind of interesting but then the the follow-up question is like okay starting to get a sense of what is intelligence

00:58:58.038 --> 00:59:05.692
how does that connector a human break is you're saying intelligence is almost like a fabric.

00:59:05.762 --> 00:59:14.650
Like what we like plug into it or something like I think you know people Consciousness plugs into it yeah I mean the intelligence I think the core.

00:59:15.439 --> 00:59:21.464
You know intelligence some level is just a word but we are asking you know what is the the notion of intelligence,

00:59:21.471 --> 00:59:27.865
as we generalize it beyond the bounds of humans beyond the bounds of even the a is that we humans are built and so on

00:59:27.844 --> 00:59:31.961
you know what what is intelligence you know is the weather

00:59:31.886 --> 00:59:44.447
you know people said the weather has a mind of its own what does that mean you know can the weather be intelligent yeah what does agency have to do with intelligence here so is intelligence just like your conception of computation just intelligence.

00:59:44.868 --> 00:59:54.521
Is a is the capacity to perform computation in a sea of yeah I think so I mean I think that's right and I think that you know this question of.

00:59:54.599 --> 01:00:03.253
Of is it for a purpose okay that quickly degenerates into a horrible philosophical mess because you know whenever you say.

01:00:03.403 --> 01:00:06.332
Did the weather do that for a purpose yeah,

01:00:06.338 --> 01:00:25.048
right well yes it did it was trying to move a bunch of hot air from the equator to the poles or something that's its purpose but why because I seem to be equally as dumb today as I was yesterday so there's some persistence like consistency over time that the intelligence I plugged into

01:00:24.874 --> 01:00:33.573
so like what's it seems like there's a hard constraint well the amount of computation I can perform in my consciousness.

01:00:33.804 --> 01:00:43.259
Aggressively really close to Connected somehow well I think the point is that the thing that gives you kind of the ability to have kind of conscious.

01:00:43.724 --> 01:00:49.903
Until intelligence you can have kind of this okay so so one thing is we don't know.

01:00:49.981 --> 01:01:03.505
Intelligence is other than the ones that are very much like us yes right and ones that are very much like us I think have this feature of single thread of time bounded you know computationally bounded now that

01:01:03.502 --> 01:01:16.379
but you also need computational sophistication having a single thread of time and being computationally bounded you could just be a clock going Tick-Tock in her that would satisfy those conditions but the fact that we have

01:01:16.376 --> 01:01:21.735
this sort of irreducible you know computational ability.

01:01:21.849 --> 01:01:30.557
That's that's an important feature that's that's the sort of the the Bedrock on which we can construct the things we construct now the fact that,

01:01:30.599 --> 01:01:41.495
we have this experience of the world that has the single thread of time and computational boundedness the thing that I sort of realized is it's that that causes us.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:49.417
To deduce from this irreducible mess of what's going on in the physical world the laws of physics that we think exists.

01:01:49.666 --> 01:02:03.406
So in other words if we say why do we believe that there is you know continuous space let's say why do we believe that gravity works the way it does well in principle we could be kind of

01:02:03.277 --> 01:02:10.032
parsing details of the universe that were you know that in okay the analogy is,

01:02:10.074 --> 01:02:22.221
again with the statistical mechanics and molecules in a box we could be sensitive to every little detail of the swirling around of these molecules and we could say what really matters.

01:02:22.326 --> 01:02:32.160
Is the you know the wiggle effect that is you know that is something that we humans just never noticed because it's some weird thing that happens when they're 15 collisions of,

01:02:32.211 --> 01:02:38.263
molecules and this happens in that happens we just see the pure motion of a ball yeah moving about.

01:02:38.557 --> 01:02:44.502
Why do we see that right and the point is that that what seems to be the case is that

01:02:44.472 --> 01:02:55.061
the things that if we say given this sort of hyper graph that's updating and all the details about all the sort of sort of atoms and space in what they do and we say how do we slice that

01:02:55.050 --> 01:03:05.792
to what we can be sensitive to what seems to be the case says that it as soon as we assume you know computational boundedness single thread of time that leads us to general relativity.

01:03:05.888 --> 01:03:14.803
In other words we can't avoid that that's the way that we we will parse the universe given those constraints we parse the universe according to

01:03:14.737 --> 01:03:19.800
those particular in such a way that we say the aggregate

01:03:19.761 --> 01:03:30.566
reducible company sort of computation pocket of computational reducibility that we slice out of this kind of Hole computational irreducible Ocean of behavior

01:03:30.446 --> 01:03:35.211
is just this one that corresponds to generativity yeah but we don't perceive general relativity.

01:03:35.695 --> 01:03:50.326
Well we do if we do fancy experiments so you're saying so perceive really does mean the full drop something that's that's a great example of general relativity in action the groundhog would like what's the difference in that in Newtonian mechanics I mean why doesn't this is

01:03:50.305 --> 01:04:04.505
when I say journal70 that's even gravity but the Uber Theory so to speak I mean you Tony and gravity is just the approximation that we can make you know on the earth and things like that so so this is you know the phenomenon of gravity,

01:04:04.538 --> 01:04:07.530
is one that is a consequence of.

01:04:07.626 --> 01:04:16.208
We would perceive something very different from Gravity so so the way to understand that is when we think about Okay so.

01:04:16.871 --> 01:04:27.335
We make up reference frames with which we parse what's happening in space and time so in other words one of the one of the things that we do is we say.

01:04:27.467 --> 01:04:31.241
As time progresses everywhere in space.

01:04:31.563 --> 01:04:44.106
Something happens at a particular time and then we go to the next time and we say this is what space is like at the next time there's what space is like at the next time that's it's the reason we are used to doing that.

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:53.936
Is because you know when we look around we might see 10 100 meters away the time it takes light to travel that distance is really short.

01:04:54.015 --> 01:05:02.074
Compared to the time it takes our brains to know what happened so as far as our brains are concerned we are parsing the universe in this

01:05:02.027 --> 01:05:15.290
there's a moment in time it's all of space there's a moment in time it's all of space you know if we were the size of planets or something we would have a different perception because the speed of light would be much more important to us we wouldn't have this perception that,

01:05:15.332 --> 01:05:21.960
things happen progressively in time everywhere in space and so that's an important kind of constraint.

01:05:22.039 --> 01:05:30.495
And the reason that we kind of parse the universe in the way that causes us to say gravity works the way it does is because we're doing things like.

01:05:30.582 --> 01:05:35.914
Deciding that we can say the universe exists space has a definite structure.

01:05:36.163 --> 01:05:43.593
There is a moment in time space says this definite structure we move to the next moment in time space as another structure that kind of setup.

01:05:43.662 --> 01:05:46.357
Is what lets us kind of deduce.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:56.259
Kind of what parse the universe in such a way that we say gravity works the way it does so that kind of reference frame is that the illusion of that.

01:05:56.868 --> 01:06:06.639
Is that you're saying that somehow useful for Consciousness like that's what Consciousness does because in a sense what Consciousness is doing is.

01:06:06.699 --> 01:06:13.787
There are it's insisting that the universe is kind of sequentialized right that is

01:06:13.712 --> 01:06:24.742
and it is not allowing the possibility that oh there are these multiple threads of time and they're all flowing differently it's like saying no you know everything is happening in this one

01:06:24.658 --> 01:06:31.098
thread of experience that we have and that illusion of that one thread of experience cannot happen at the planetary scale.

01:06:31.347 --> 01:06:36.526
0iu saying typical human are you saying we are at a human level especially.

01:06:36.865 --> 01:06:45.222
Here for Consciousness like well for our kind of Consciousness it's you know if we existed at a scale close to the elementary length for example.

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:52.973
Then our perception of the universe will be absurdly different okay so but this makes this Consciousness seem like a weird side effect of this particular scale.

01:06:53.529 --> 01:06:57.402
And so who cares Amy well Consciousness is not that special.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:03.722
I think look I think that a very interesting question is which I've certainly thought a little bit about is

01:07:03.692 --> 01:07:14.444
what can you imagine what is a sort of factoring of something you know what are some other possible ways you could exist so to speak write and you know if you were a photon

01:07:14.414 --> 01:07:19.656
if you were sort of you know some kind of thing that was kind of you know

01:07:19.635 --> 01:07:30.585
intelligence represented in terms of photons you know for example the photons we receive in the cosmic microwave background those photons as far as they're concerned the universe just started

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:36.058
they were admitted in 100,000 years off of the beginning of the universe they've been traveling at the speed of light.

01:07:36.145 --> 01:07:43.728
Time stayed still for them and then they just arrived and we just detected them so for them the universe just started.

01:07:43.806 --> 01:07:56.052
And that's a different perception of you know that has implications for a very different perception of time they don't have their single thread that seems to be really important for being able to tell a heck of a good story so we humans,

01:07:56.085 --> 01:08:03.299
we can tell a story we write we can tell a story and we another kind of stories can you tell so photons have really boring story.

01:08:03.764 --> 01:08:07.791
Yeah I mean so so that's it I don't know if they're boring story but I think it's,

01:08:07.824 --> 01:08:20.664
you know I've been wondering about this and I've been asking you know friends of mine who was science fiction writers and things have you written stuff about this and I hope one example the great great question of books from my friend Rudy Rucker which were.

01:08:20.743 --> 01:08:29.937
Which I have to say the books about that a very informed by bunch of science that I've done and the thing that I really loved about them is that you know.

01:08:30.042 --> 01:08:32.899
And the first chapter of the book.

01:08:33.202 --> 01:08:42.450
The Earth is consumed by these things he called Nance which are Nano Nano Bots type things and it's so you know so the Earth is gone in the first but then it.

01:08:42.546 --> 01:08:51.866
But but but then boil alert yeah right that was a that was only a microscope is only chapter 1 okay it's some the but the thing that,

01:08:51.917 --> 01:08:58.636
is not a real spoiler alert because it's such a complicated concept but but in the end in the end,

01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:09.808
the Earth is saved by this thing called the principle of computational equivalence which is a kind of a core scientific idea of mine and I was just like like thrilled I don't read fiction books very often

01:09:09.616 --> 01:09:21.097
and I was just thrilled I get to the end of this and it's like oh my gosh you know everything is saved by this sort of deep scientific principle can you give me be elaborate called the principle of computational

01:09:20.896 --> 01:09:25.076
equivalence can save our planet.

01:09:25.856 --> 01:09:34.492
That would that would be a terrible spoiler for me that would be a spoiler yeah but no but I let me say what the principle of computational equivalence is mmm.

01:09:34.939 --> 01:09:42.909
So the question is you are you have a system you have some rule you can think of Its Behavior as corresponding to a computation.

01:09:43.230 --> 01:09:52.299
The question is how sophisticated is that computation the statement of the principle of computational equivalence is as soon as it's not obviously simple,

01:09:52.314 --> 01:10:00.220
it will be as sophisticated as anything and so that has the implication that you know rule 30 you know our brains,

01:10:00.272 --> 01:10:05.136
other things in physics there all ultimately equivalent in the computations they can do

01:10:05.124 --> 01:10:10.852
and that's what leads to this computational irreducibility idea because the reason we don't get to jump ahead,

01:10:10.867 --> 01:10:19.251
you know and out think rule 30 is because we're just computationally equivalent to rule 30 so we're kind of just both just running computations.

01:10:19.366 --> 01:10:29.982
That are the same sort of raw the same level of computation so to speak so that's kind of the idea there and the question I mean it's like the

01:10:29.844 --> 01:10:39.146
you know in the science fiction version would be okay somebody says we just need more servers get us more servers the way to get even more servers is.

01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:53.199
Turn the whole planet into a bunch of micro servers and that that's that's where it starts and so the question of you know computational equivalence principle of computational equivalence is well actually you don't need to build those custom servers

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:59.438
actually you can you can just use natural computation.

01:10:59.579 --> 01:11:06.108
To compute things so to speak you can use nature to compute you don't need to have done all that engineering and it's kind of the

01:11:05.943 --> 01:11:18.937
it's kind of feels a little disappointing that you say we're going to build all these servers we're going to do all these things we're going to make you know maybe we're going to have human consciousness uploaded into you know some elaborate digital environment.

01:11:19.033 --> 01:11:25.931
And then you look at that thing and you say it's got electrons moving around just like in a rock and then you say well what's the difference.

01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:34.141
I'm principal computational equivalence says there isn't at some level a fundamental you know you can't say mathematically,

01:11:34.147 --> 01:11:42.702
there's a fundamental difference between the rock that is the future of human consciousness and The Rock that's just a rock now what.

01:11:42.808 --> 01:11:51.678
I've sort of realized with this kind of Consciousness thing is there is a there is an aspect of this that seems to be more special that isn't,

01:11:51.693 --> 01:12:06.621
and for example something I haven't really teased a pot properly is when it comes to something like the weather and the weather having a mind of its own or whatever or your average you know Pulsar magnetosphere acting like a sort of intelligent thing how does that relate to

01:12:06.547 --> 01:12:09.061
you know how to how is that.

01:12:09.607 --> 01:12:19.270
That entity related to the kind of Consciousness that we have and sort of what would the world look like you know to the weather if we think about the weather as a mind.

01:12:19.456 --> 01:12:24.176
What will it perceive what will it lose its laws of physics B I don't really know.

01:12:24.461 --> 01:12:30.225
Because it's very parallel it's very powerful among other things and it it's not obvious,

01:12:30.259 --> 01:12:40.533
I mean this is a really kind of mind-bending thing because we've got to try and imagine where you know we've got to try and imagine a parsing of the universe different from the one we have.

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:49.967
And by the way when we think about extraterrestrial intelligence and so on I think that's kind of the key thing is you know we've always assumed I've always assumed,

01:12:49.983 --> 01:12:56.160
okay the extraterrestrials at least they have the same physics we all live in the same universe they've got the same physics.

01:12:56.302 --> 01:13:03.075
But actually that's not really right because the extraterrestrials could have a completely different way of parsing.

01:13:03.252 --> 01:13:14.310
That the universe so it's as if you know that could be for all we know right here in this room you know in the in the details of the motion of these gas molecules that could be an amazing intelligence.

01:13:14.406 --> 01:13:16.353
That we would like but we have,

01:13:16.386 --> 01:13:24.653
no way of we're not parsing the universe in the same way if only we could parse the universe in the right way you know immediately this amazing

01:13:24.605 --> 01:13:35.015
thing that's going on in this you know huge culture that's developed and all that kind of thing would be obvious to us but it's not because we have a particular way of passing the universe would that thing also have us.

01:13:35.111 --> 01:13:47.113
Agency I don't know the right word to use but something like Consciousness but a different kind of Consciousness I think it's a question of just what you mean by the word because I think that the you know this notion of Consciousness on the,

01:13:47.138 --> 01:13:53.451
okay so some people think of Consciousness as sort of a key aspect of it is that we feel that.

01:13:53.656 --> 01:14:03.678
The sort of a feeling of that we exist in some way that we have this intrinsic feeling about ourselves you know I suspect that.

01:14:03.747 --> 01:14:14.517
Any of these things would also have an intrinsic feeling about themselves I've been sort of trying to think recently about constructing an experiment about what if you were just a piece of a cellular automaton let's see.

01:14:14.658 --> 01:14:24.284
You know what would your feeling about yourself actually be and you know can we put ourselves in the in the shoes in the cells of the cellular automaton so to speak.

01:14:24.398 --> 01:14:33.493
Can we can we get ourselves close enough to that that we can have a sense of what the world would be like if you were operating in that way,

01:14:33.554 --> 01:14:43.711
and it's a little difficult because you know you have to not only think about what are you perceiving but also what's actually going on in your brain and our brains do what they actually do.

01:14:43.861 --> 01:14:50.886
And they don't it's you know I think there might be some experiments that are possible with with you know knowing that's and so on

01:14:50.847 --> 01:15:00.806
where you can have something where you can at least see in detail what's happening inside the system and I've been sort of one of the one of my projects to think about is there a way of kind of,

01:15:00.866 --> 01:15:13.571
kind of getting a sense kind of from inside the system about what its view of the world is and how it how it you know can can we make a Bridge City the main issue is this what we're,

01:15:13.578 --> 01:15:14.175
you know,

01:15:14.181 --> 01:15:26.130
it's a sort of philosophically difficult thing because it's like we do what we do we understand ourselves at least to some extent we humans understand ourselves that's correct and but yet,

01:15:26.154 --> 01:15:35.186
okay so what are we trying to do for example when we are trying to make a model of physics what are we actually trying to do because you know you say well can we work out what the universe does.

01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:44.773
Well of course we can't we just watch the universe the universe does what it does but what we're trying to do when we make a model of physics is we're trying to get to the point where we can tell a story,

01:15:44.825 --> 01:15:50.183
to ourselves that we understand that is also a representation of what the universe does.

01:15:50.370 --> 01:15:55.585
So it's this kind of you know can we make a bridge between what we humans can understand in our minds,

01:15:55.591 --> 01:16:09.673
and what the universe does and in a sense you know a large part of my kind of Life efforts have been devoted to making computational language which kind of is a bridge between what is possible in the computational universe,

01:16:09.707 --> 01:16:18.235
and what we humans can conceptualize and think about in a sense what you know when I built well from language and our whole sort of computational language story.

01:16:18.394 --> 01:16:24.554
It's all about how do you take sort of raw computation and this ocean of computational possibility,

01:16:24.597 --> 01:16:30.550
and how do we sort of represent pieces of it in a way that we humans can understand and,

01:16:30.574 --> 01:16:45.151
that map onto things that we care about doing and in a sense when you add physics you're adding this other piece where we can you know mediated by computer can we get physics to the point where we humans can understand something about what's happening in it,

01:16:45.194 --> 01:16:49.670
and when we talk about an alien intelligence it's kind of the same story it's like.

01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:57.340
Is the a way of mapping what's happening they're onto something that we humans can understand and you know physics,

01:16:57.383 --> 01:17:00.320
in some sense is like our

01:17:00.318 --> 01:17:12.752
exhibit one of the story of alien intelligences it's a it's a you know it's an alien intelligence in some sense and what we're doing in making a model of physics is mapping that onto something that we understand.

01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:13.707
And I think

01:17:13.695 --> 01:17:23.708
you know a lot of these other things that have recently been kind of studying whether it's microbiology other kinds of things which we can talk about a bit the

01:17:23.705 --> 01:17:36.842
those are other cases where we're in a sense trying to again make that bridge between what we humans understand and sort of the natural language of that sort of alien intelligence in some sense when you're talking about.

01:17:37.101 --> 01:17:46.529
Just to backtrack a little bit about cellular am being able to what's it like to be a cellular automata.

01:17:46.814 --> 01:17:53.244
In the way that's equivalent to what it's like to be a conscious human being,

01:17:53.296 --> 01:18:01.112
how do you approach that so is it looking at some subset of the cellular automata asking questions of that subset.

01:18:01.353 --> 01:18:07.540
Like how the world is perceived how you doing like as that subset.

01:18:08.069 --> 01:18:16.200
Like for that local pocket of computation what are you able to say about the broader something like and that's somehow than.

01:18:16.603 --> 01:18:23.933
I can give you a sense of how to step outside of that so right but the tricky part is that that little subset.

01:18:24.444 --> 01:18:31.054
It's what it's doing is it has a view of itself and the question is how do you get inside it.

01:18:31.150 --> 01:18:41.650
It's like you know when we with humans right it's like we can't get inside each other's Consciousness that doesn't really you know that doesn't really even make sense

01:18:41.647 --> 01:18:49.239
it's like there is an experience that somebody is having but you can perceive things from the outside but sort of getting inside it.

01:18:49.407 --> 01:18:59.015
It doesn't it doesn't quite make sense and I you know for me these sort of philosophical issues in this one I have not untangled so let's be sure the you know for me

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:12.284
the thing that has been really interesting and thinking through some of these things as you know when it comes to questions about Consciousness or whatever else it's like when I can run a program and actually see pictures and you know make things concrete

01:19:12.201 --> 01:19:21.800
I have a much better chance to understand what's going on then when I'm just trying to reason about things in a very abstract whatever that may be a way to map.

01:19:22.977 --> 01:19:30.919
The program to your conscious experience so for example you play a video game you do a first person shooter you walk around inside.

01:19:31.484 --> 01:19:44.189
This entity the up is very different thing than watching this entity so if you can somehow connect more and more connects this full conscious experience to the subset of the cellular automata

01:19:44.141 --> 01:19:50.355
yeah it's something like that but the difference in the first-person shooter thing is this still your brain and your memory.

01:19:50.433 --> 01:19:57.395
It's still remembering you know you you still have it's hard to I mean again what one's going to get.

01:19:57.806 --> 01:20:06.658
One is not going to actually be able to be the cellular automaton once going to be able to watch what the cellular automaton does but this is the frustrating thing that I'm trying to understand.

01:20:07.178 --> 01:20:21.206
You know how to how to think about being it so to speak okay so like in virtual reality there's a concept of immersion like with anything with video game with books this concept of immersion it feels like over time if the virtual reality

01:20:21.167 --> 01:20:28.939
experience is as well done and maybe in the future will be extremely well done the immersion leads you to.

01:20:29.476 --> 01:20:33.017
I feel like you mentioned memories you forget.

01:20:33.419 --> 01:20:44.378
They you even ever existed outside that experience the also immersive I mean you could argue sort of mathematically that you can never truly become a murse but maybe you can,

01:20:44.393 --> 01:20:52.200
I mean well yeah why can't you merge with the Cellular Tower that yeah but I mean you're probably just part of the same fabric why can't you just like.

01:20:52.333 --> 01:21:07.289
Well that's a good question I mean so so let's imagine the following scenario let's imagine return what's that well but then can you return back well yeah right I mean it's like let's imagine you've uploaded you know your brain is scanned you've got every synapse you know mapped out.

01:21:07.385 --> 01:21:16.948
You upload everything about you the brain stimulator you upload the brain stimulator and the Brain stimulator is basically you know some glorified cellular automaton.

01:21:17.044 --> 01:21:23.321
And then you say well now we've got an answer to what does it feel like to be a cellular automaton it feels just like it felt.

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:37.914
To be ordinary you because that both computational systems and they're both you know operating in the same way so in a sense but I think there's there's somehow more to it because in that sense when you just making a brain simulator it's just you know.

01:21:38.083 --> 01:21:46.772
With just saying there's another version of our Consciousness the question that we're asking is if we tease away from our Consciousness and get to something that is different.

01:21:46.923 --> 01:21:52.489
How do we make a bridge to understanding what's going on there and you know there's a way of thinking about this

01:21:52.432 --> 01:22:02.239
okay so this is coming on to sort of questions about the existence of the universe and so on but one of the things is there's this notion that we have of rule space

01:22:02.092 --> 01:22:11.817
so we have this idea of this physical space which is you know something you can move around in that's that's associated with that actual the extent of the spatial hypergraph

01:22:11.670 --> 01:22:14.022
then there's what we call Braun she'll space

01:22:13.939 --> 01:22:25.707
the space of quantum branches so in this in this thing we call the multi-way graph of all of this sort of branching histories there's this idea of a kind of space where instead of moving around and physical space

01:22:25.633 --> 01:22:33.846
you're moving from history to history so to speak from one possible history to another possible history and that's kind of a different kind of space that

01:22:33.717 --> 01:22:36.474
is the space in which quantum mechanics plays out,

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:46.070
quantum mechanics like for example oh something like I think we're slowly understanding things like destructive interference and quantum mechanics that what's happening is

01:22:45.996 --> 01:22:59.718
bronze Shields space is associated with phase and quantum mechanics and what's happening is the two photons that are supposed to be interfering and destructively destructive interfering a winding up a different ends of bronchial space and so us as these poor Observers

01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:05.849
that are trying to that have branching brains that are trying to conflate together these different threads of History.

01:23:05.909 --> 01:23:11.295
And say we've really got a consistent story that were telling how we're really knitting together these threads of History,

01:23:11.328 --> 01:23:19.829
by the time the two photons wound up at opposite ends of bronchial space we just can't knit them together to tell a consistent story so for us,

01:23:19.844 --> 01:23:31.550
that's sort of the analog of destructive interference got it and then there's rule Hill space to which is the space of rules yes well that's that's another level up so so there's there's the question.

01:23:31.655 --> 01:23:43.865
Actually I do want to mention one thing because it's something I've realized in recent times and it's I think it's really really kind of cool which is about time dilation and relativity and it kind of helps to understand it's something that kind of helps,

01:23:43.916 --> 01:23:51.679
and understanding what's going on so in according to relativity if you you know you have a clock it's taking it a certain rate.

01:23:51.856 --> 01:24:00.357
You send it a spacecraft that's going at some significant fraction of the speed of light to you as a Observer at rest that clock,

01:24:00.399 --> 01:24:07.622
that's in the spacecraft will seem to be taking much more slowly and so in other words you know it's kind of like the

01:24:07.538 --> 01:24:22.304
the twin who goes off to Alpha Centauri and goes very fast will age much less than the twin who's on Earth that that is just hanging out whether hanging out okay why does that happen Okay so it has to do with what motion is so

01:24:22.284 --> 01:24:24.564
in and out models of physics.

01:24:24.706 --> 01:24:33.270
What is motion when you move from somewhere to somewhere it's you having to sort of recreate yourself at a different place in space.

01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:41.902
When you existed a particular place and you just evolved with time your again you're updating yourself you're following these rules to update what happens.

01:24:42.224 --> 01:24:51.589
Well so the question is when you have a certain amount of computation in you so to speak when there's a certain amount you know you're Computing the universe is Computing at a certain rate.

01:24:51.811 --> 01:24:59.241
You can either use that computation to work out sitting still where you are what's going to happen successively in time.

01:24:59.301 --> 01:25:10.467
Or you can use that computation to recreate yourself as you move around the universe and so time dilation ends up being as it's really cool actually that this is explainable in a in a way that isn't just

01:25:10.338 --> 01:25:19.910
imagine the mathematics of Relativity but but that time dilation is a story of the fact that as you kind of recreating yourself as you move

01:25:19.844 --> 01:25:22.070
you are using up some of your computation,

01:25:22.104 --> 01:25:31.937
and so you don't have as much computation left over to actually work out what happens progressively with time so that means that time is running more slowly for you because

01:25:31.889 --> 01:25:38.130
it is your you're using up your computation your clock can't take as quickly because

01:25:38.092 --> 01:25:48.114
every tick of the clock is using up some computation but you already use that computation up on moving up you know half the speed of light or something and so that's that's why time dilation happens.

01:25:48.526 --> 01:26:00.006
And so you can you can start so it's kind of interesting that one can sort of get an intuition about something like that because it has seemed like just a mathematical fact about the mathematics of special relativity and so on.

01:26:00.148 --> 01:26:07.280
Well for me it's a little bit confusing what the you and that picture is because you're using up computation.

01:26:07.358 --> 01:26:10.350
Okay so so what somebody's saying,

01:26:10.401 --> 01:26:19.271
The Entity is updating itself according to the way that the Universe updates itself and the question is your.

01:26:19.394 --> 01:26:30.785
You know those updates that's imagine the you is a clock okay and the caulk has you know there's all these the updates the hypergraph and a sequence of updates cause the pendulum to swing back the other way

01:26:30.728 --> 01:26:36.889
and then swing back swinging back and forth okay and all of the all of those updates.

01:26:36.949 --> 01:26:43.451
All contributing to the motion of the pendulum going back and forth or the little oscillator moving whatever it is.

01:26:43.710 --> 01:26:53.606
Okay but but then the alternative is that sort of situation one where the thing is that rest situation to where it's kind of moving the the what's happening is

01:26:53.576 --> 01:27:01.761
it is having to recreate itself at every at every moment the thing is going to have to do the computations to be able to

01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:04.778
sort of recreate itself at a different position in space,

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:14.248
and that's kind of the intuition behind so it's either going to spend its computation recreating itself at a different position in space or it's going to spend its computation

01:27:14.236 --> 01:27:18.587
doing the sort of doing the updating of.

01:27:18.656 --> 01:27:26.203
The you know of the ticking of the clock so to speak so the more updating is doing the less the ticking of the clock up days doing.

01:27:26.362 --> 01:27:31.622
That's right the more it's as having to update because of motion yeah the less it can update the the clock.

01:27:31.836 --> 01:27:46.062
So that's some I mean obviously there's a there's a sort of mathematical version of it that relates to how it actually works in relativity but that's kind of to me that was sort of exciting to me that it's possible to have a really mechanically explainable story there.

01:27:46.176 --> 01:27:52.175
That that isn't and it's similarly in quantum mechanics this notion of branching brains perceiving branching universes,

01:27:52.217 --> 01:28:01.582
to me that's getting towards a sort of mechanically explainable version of what happens in quantum mechanics even though it's a little bit mind-bending to see you know these things about

01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:08.586
under what circumstances can you successfully knit together those different threads of history and when two things sort of Escape.

01:28:08.646 --> 01:28:14.023
And those kinds of things but the you know the thing about this physical space,

01:28:14.056 --> 01:28:23.188
and physical space the main sort of big theory is generativity the theory of gravity and that tells you how things move and physical space.

01:28:23.257 --> 01:28:35.412
And bronze Shields space the big theory is the firemen path integral which it turns out tells you essentially how things move and Quantum in the space of quantum phases so it's kind of like motion and bronchial space.

01:28:35.743 --> 01:28:39.158
And it's kind of a fun thing to start thinking about what.

01:28:39.650 --> 01:28:54.146
Oh you know all these things that we know in physical space like event Horizons and black holes and so on what are the analogous things in Broncho space for example the speed of light what's the analog of the speed of light and bronchial space it's the maximum speed of quantum entanglement.

01:28:54.413 --> 01:28:56.513
So the speed of light is.

01:28:56.637 --> 01:29:05.255
Flash bulb goes off here what's the maximum rate at which the effect of that flashbulb is detectable moving away in space.

01:29:05.585 --> 01:29:09.720
So similarly in bronchial space something happens and the question is

01:29:09.672 --> 01:29:20.693
how far in this brown she'll space in the space of quantum States how far away can that get within a certain period of time and so there's this notion of a maximum entanglement speed and

01:29:20.592 --> 01:29:32.072
that might be observable that's the thing we've been sort of poking at his might there be a way to observe it even in some Atomic physics kind of situation that because one of the things that's weird in quantum mechanics,

01:29:32.115 --> 01:29:36.393
is will you know when we study quantum mechanics we mostly study it,

01:29:36.409 --> 01:29:42.272
in terms of small numbers of particles you know this electron does this this thing on an ion trap does that and so on,

01:29:42.297 --> 01:29:50.293
but when we do with large numbers of particles kind of all bets are off it's kind of too complicated to deal with quantum mechanics and so what ends up happening is

01:29:50.155 --> 01:30:03.661
so this question about maximum entanglement speed and things like that may actually play in one of these in the sort of story of many-body quantum mechanics and even have some suspicions about things that might happen even in,

01:30:03.704 --> 01:30:11.575
one of the things I realized I'd never understood and it's kind of embarrassing but I think I Now understand a little better is when you have chemistry.

01:30:11.887 --> 01:30:17.327
And you have quantum mechanics it's like well there's two carbon atoms is this molecule and we do a reaction.

01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:22.323
And we draw a diagram we said this carbon atom ends up in this place it's like but wait a minute

01:30:22.321 --> 01:30:34.936
and quantum mechanics nothing ends up in a definite place there's always just some wave function for this to happen how can it be the case that we can draw these reasonable it just ended up in this place and you have to kind of say well the environment of the molecule,

01:30:34.978 --> 01:30:41.831
effectively made a bunch of measurements on the molecule to keep it kind of classical and that's a story that has to do with.

01:30:41.892 --> 01:30:46.819
This whole thing about about you know measurements have to do with this idea

01:30:46.816 --> 01:31:00.997
of you know can we conclude that something definite happened because in quantum mechanics the intrinsic quantum mechanics the mathematics of quantum mechanics is all about they're just these amplitudes for different things to happen then there's this thing of and then we make a measurement.

01:31:01.066 --> 01:31:10.161
And we conclude that something definite happened and that has to do with this thing I think about sort of moving about knitting together these different threads of History,

01:31:10.186 --> 01:31:17.552
and saying this is now something where we can definitively say something definite happen in the traditional theory of quantum mechanics it's just like.

01:31:17.685 --> 01:31:27.599
You know after you've done all the sample should computation then this big hammer comes down and you do a measurement and it's all over and that's been very confusing for example in Quantum computing.

01:31:27.668 --> 01:31:30.768
It's been a very confusing thing because when you say

01:31:30.729 --> 01:31:45.594
you know in Quantum Computing the basic idea is you're going to use all these separate threads of computation so to speak to do all the different parts of you know try these different factors for an integer or something like this and it looks like you can do a lot because you've got all these different threads going on.

01:31:45.736 --> 01:31:53.507
But then you have to say well at the end of it you've got all these threads and every thread came up with a definite answer but we got to conflate those together

01:31:53.460 --> 01:32:01.870
to figure out a definite thing that we humans can take away from it a definite so the computer actually produced this output so having

01:32:01.823 --> 01:32:14.168
this Branch all space and this hyper graph model of physics do you think it's possible to then make predictions that are definite about many-body quantum mechanical systems

01:32:14.156 --> 01:32:16.418
is that the whole I think it's likely yes.

01:32:16.586 --> 01:32:24.196
But I don't you know this is every one of these things when you when you go from the underlying Theory which is complicated enough in its I mean

01:32:24.076 --> 01:32:34.468
the theory at some level is beautifully simple but as soon as you start actually trying to it's this whole question about how do you bridge it to things that we humans can talk about it gets really complicated,

01:32:34.528 --> 01:32:40.310
and and this thing about actually getting it to a definite definite prediction

01:32:40.307 --> 01:32:49.771
about you know definite thing you can say about chemistry or something like this you know that's just a lot of work so I'll give you an example there's a thing called the quantum Zeno effect so

01:32:49.715 --> 01:33:03.950
the idea is you know Quantum stuff happens but then if you make a measurement your kind of freezing time in quantum mechanics you and and so it looks like there's a possibility that would sort of the relationship between the quantum Zeno effect.

01:33:04.037 --> 01:33:12.070
And the way that many-body quantum mechanics works and so on maybe just conceivably it may be possible to actually figure out a way to measure.

01:33:12.139 --> 01:33:21.711
The maximum entanglement speed and the reason we can potentially do that is because the systems we deal with in terms of atoms and things they're pretty big

01:33:21.592 --> 01:33:36.295
you know a mole of atoms is you know it's a lot of atoms and you know but it isn't a very you know it's something where to get you know when we're dealing with how can you see 10 to the minus 100 so to speak well by the time you've got you know 10 to the 30th Adams.

01:33:36.445 --> 01:33:43.272
You're not you know you with in a little bit closer Striking Distance of that it's not like oh we've just got you know.

01:33:43.503 --> 01:33:48.124
Two atoms and we're trying to see down to 10 to the minus 100 meters or whatever.

01:33:48.265 --> 01:33:57.397
So I don't know how it work but this is a this is a potential direction if you can tell by the way if we could measure the maximum entanglement speed,

01:33:57.412 --> 01:34:04.220
we would know the elementary length these are all related so if we get that one number we just need one number.

01:34:04.308 --> 01:34:08.307
If we can get that one number we can you know the theory has no parameters anymore.

01:34:08.521 --> 01:34:15.419
Um under you know there are other places well there's another another hope for doing that is in cosmology.

01:34:15.488 --> 01:34:24.160
And this model one of the features is the universe is not fixed dimensional I mean we think we live in three-dimensional space but this hypergraph doesn't have any particular dimension.

01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:37.997
It can emerge as something which on an approximation it's as if you know you say what's the volume of a sphere in the hyper graph where a sphere is defined as how many nodes do you get to when you go a distance R away from a given point.

01:34:38.057 --> 01:34:42.228
And you can say well if I get to about our Cube nodes,

01:34:42.243 --> 01:34:52.022
when I go a distance R away in the hypergraph then I'm living roughly in three-dimensional space but you might also get to our to the point you know 2.92

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:54.462
you know for some value of r

01:34:54.441 --> 01:35:04.275
and you know as R increases that might be the sort of fit to what happens and so one of the things we suspect is that the very early Universe was essentially infinite dimensional.

01:35:04.416 --> 01:35:09.351
And that as the universe expanded it became lower dimensional.

01:35:09.466 --> 01:35:18.444
And so one of the things that is another little sort of point where we think there might be a way to actually measure some things is to mention fluctuations in the early universe,

01:35:18.504 --> 01:35:30.912
that is is there a is there leftover Dimension fluctuation of at the time of the cosmic microwave background 100,000 years or something after the beginning of the universe is it still the case that there are there were pieces of the universe

01:35:30.891 --> 01:35:38.321
that didn't have to mention three that had to mention 3.01 or something and can we tell that is that possible to observe.

01:35:38.399 --> 01:35:46.297
The fluctuations in Dimensions I don't even know what that entails okay so the the question.

01:35:46.528 --> 01:35:58.756
Which should be an elementary exercise in electrodynamics except it isn't is some understanding what happens to a photon when it propagates through 3.0 one dimensional space so for example the inverse Square law

01:35:58.708 --> 01:36:03.608
is a consequence of the you know the surface area of a sphere is

01:36:03.570 --> 01:36:10.576
proportional to r squared but if you're not in three dimensional space the surface area of sphere is not,

01:36:10.627 --> 01:36:17.363
proportional to r squared it's are to the whatever 2.01 or something and so that means that.

01:36:17.856 --> 01:36:21.037
I think when you kind dry and do Optics.

01:36:21.124 --> 01:36:35.846
You know a common principle in Optics is Huygens principle which basically says that every piece of a wave front of a light is a source of new spherical waves and those spherical waves if they're different dimensional spherical waves.

01:36:35.915 --> 01:36:41.192
We'll have other characteristics and so there will be bizarre Optical phenomena,

01:36:41.235 --> 01:36:53.210
which we haven't figured out yet so you're what looking for some weird Photon trajectories that designate that it's 3.01 dimensional space yeah.

01:36:53.361 --> 01:37:03.960
Yeah that would be an example of I mean you know there are only a certain number of things we can measure about photons you know we can measure the polarization we can measure that frequency we can measure that direction,

01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:11.710
those kinds of things and you know how that all works out and you know in the current models of physics.

01:37:11.861 --> 01:37:20.587
You know it's been hard to explain how the universe managers to be as uniform as it is and that's led to this inflation idea that to the,

01:37:20.593 --> 01:37:32.020
the great annoyance of my then collaborator I we hit we figured out and like 1979 we had this realization that you could get something like this but it seemed implausible that's the way the universe works so we put in a footnote

01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:38.474
until that was so that's a but any case I've never really completely believed it but this

01:37:38.399 --> 01:37:52.544
that's an idea for how to Puff out the universe faster than the speed of light early moments of the universe that that's the sort of inflation idea and that that you can somehow explain how the universe manages to be as uniform as it is

01:37:52.488 --> 01:37:59.773
in our model this turns out to be much more natural because the universe just starts very connected the hypergraph is not.

01:37:59.933 --> 01:38:08.857
Such that the ball that you grow starting from a single point has volume R cubed it might have volume art of the 500 or art of the infinity.

01:38:09.016 --> 01:38:20.137
Um and so that means that you sort of naturally get this much higher degree of connectivity in uniformity in the universe and then the question is this is sort of mathematical physics challenge.

01:38:20.242 --> 01:38:33.946
Is in the standard theory of the universe there's the Freebird moments of Wako Universe which is the kind of standard model where the universe is isotropic and homogeneous and you can then work out the equations of general relativity and you can figure out how the universe expands.

01:38:34.123 --> 01:38:39.860
We would like to do the same kind of thing including Dimension change this is just difficult mathematical physics.

01:38:40.002 --> 01:38:49.295
I mean the reason it's difficult is the sort of fundamental reason it's difficult when when people invented calculus 300 years ago calculus was a story of understanding.

01:38:49.373 --> 01:38:52.806
Change and change as a function of a variable,

01:38:52.857 --> 01:39:03.537
so people study univariate calculus they study multivariate calculus it's one variable its two variables three variables but who ever studied you know 2.5 variable calculus.

01:39:03.732 --> 01:39:04.932
Turns out nobody.

01:39:05.217 --> 01:39:17.841
Turns out that but what we need to have to understand these fractional dimensional spaces which don't work like well there are spaces where where the effective Dimension is not.

01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:21.091
An integer you can't apply the tools of calculus

01:39:20.998 --> 01:39:31.516
and naturally and easily to fractional Dimensions know somebody has to figure out how to do that we are trying to figure this out I mean it's it's very interesting and it's very

01:39:31.333 --> 01:39:43.129
connected to very Frontier issues in mathematics is very beautiful but so is it possible is it possible we're dealing with scale that's so so much smaller than our human scale.

01:39:43.324 --> 01:39:53.319
Is it possible to make predictions versus explanations do you have a hope that will just hyper graph model you'll be able to make predictions yeah that,

01:39:53.379 --> 01:40:11.791
then could be validated with a physics experiment predictions that couldn't have been done or weren't done otherwise yeah I mean you know I think which in which domain do you think okay so they're going to be cosmology ones to do with Dimension fluctuations in the universe that's a very bizarre effect nobody you know Dimension fluctuation is just something

01:40:11.618 --> 01:40:18.868
nobody ever looked for that if anybody sees Dimension fluctuation that's a huge flag that the that something like our model is going on.

01:40:18.991 --> 01:40:23.387
If and how one detects that you know that's a problem of kind of

01:40:23.384 --> 01:40:34.307
you know that's a problem of traditional physics in a sense of what's the best way to actually figure that out and for example that's one there are there are all kinds of things one can imagine I mean their things.

01:40:34.376 --> 01:40:43.435
That in black hole mergers it's possible that there will be effects of Maximum entanglement speed and large black hole mergers,

01:40:43.486 --> 01:40:54.679
that's another another possible thing and all of that is detected through like what do you have a hope for ligo type of situation like this gravitational waves or alternatively I mean,

01:40:54.739 --> 01:40:58.586
I think it's you know look figuring out experiments.

01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:07.336
Is like figuring out technology inventions that is you know you've got a set of raw materials you've got an underlying model and now you've got to be very clever,

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:13.800
to figure out you know what is that thing I can measure that just somehow you know Leverage is into the right place.

01:41:13.896 --> 01:41:17.437
And we've spent less effort on that than I would have liked.

01:41:17.569 --> 01:41:31.129
Because I was one of the one of the reasons is that that I think that the this you know the physicists have been working on on our models and we know lots of visitors such as very very nice it's kind of it's one of these cases where

01:41:31.108 --> 01:41:33.209
I'm almost I'm really kind of

01:41:33.179 --> 01:41:45.046
pleasantly surprised that the sort of absorption of the things we've done has been quite rapid and quite sort of you know very positive so it's a Cambrian explosion of physicists to not just ideas.

01:41:45.242 --> 01:41:48.359
Yes I mean you know a lot of what's happened.

01:41:48.617 --> 01:41:57.056
Really interesting and again not what I expected is there are a lot of areas of sort of very elaborate sophisticated mathematical physics.

01:41:57.170 --> 01:42:11.477
Whether that's causal set theory whether it's higher category Theory whether its categorical quantum mechanics all sorts of elaborate names for these things spin that works perhaps you know causal dynamical triangulations all kinds of names of

01:42:11.393 --> 01:42:18.913
of these fields and these fields have a bunch of good mathematical physicists in them who've been working for decades and these particular areas.

01:42:19.063 --> 01:42:23.522
And the question is but but that they've been building these mathematical structures.

01:42:23.708 --> 01:42:34.217
And the mathematical structures are interesting but they're not they don't typically sit on anything they just mathematical structures and I think what's happened is our models provide kind of machine code.

01:42:34.286 --> 01:42:36.224
That lives underneath those models,

01:42:36.248 --> 01:42:45.407
so typical example this is due to Jonathan gorod who's one of the key people has been working on a project this is

01:42:45.359 --> 01:42:53.850
and okay so cause I'll give you an example just to give a sense of how these things connect this is in causal set theory so the idea of causal set theory is.

01:42:54.001 --> 01:43:01.142
There are in space time we imagine that there's space and time it's a 3 plus 1 dimensional you know setup.

01:43:01.230 --> 01:43:07.885
We imagine that there are just events that happen at different times and places in space and time.

01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:17.031
And the idea of causal set theory is the only thing you said about the universe is there a bunch of events that happen sort of randomly at different places in space and time.

01:43:17.227 --> 01:43:26.745
And then the whole sort of Theory of physics has to be to do with the this graph of causal relationships between these randomly thrown down events.

01:43:26.895 --> 01:43:32.966
So they've always been confused by the fact that to get even Ranson variants even relativistic invariance

01:43:32.954 --> 01:43:43.282
you need a very special way to throw down those events and they've had no natural way to understand how that would happen so what Jonathan figured out is that in fact from our models,

01:43:43.342 --> 01:43:49.017
they instead of just generating a rents at random our models

01:43:48.942 --> 01:44:03.204
necessarily generate events in some pattern in space-time effectively that then leads to run some variants and relativistic invariance and all those kinds of things so it's a place where all the mathematics that's been done on well we just have a random collection of events,

01:44:03.255 --> 01:44:06.535
now what you know what consequences does that have in terms of.

01:44:06.604 --> 01:44:19.327
Causal set there and so on that can all be kind of wheeled in now that we have some different underlying foundational idea for what the particular distribution of events is as opposed to just what we throw down random events.

01:44:19.414 --> 01:44:26.502
And so that's a that's a typical sort of example of what we're seeing in all these different areas of kind of how you can take,

01:44:26.553 --> 01:44:41.536
you know really interesting things that have been done in mathematical physics and connect them and it's really kind of beautiful because the you know the sort of the abstract models we have just seem to plug into all these different very interesting very elegant abstract ideas.

01:44:41.641 --> 01:44:49.322
But we're now giving sort of a reason for that to be the way for a reason for one to care I mean it's like saying,

01:44:49.383 --> 01:45:01.971
you can you know you can think about computation abstractly you know you can think about I don't know combinator's or something as abstract computational things and you can sort of do all kinds of study of them but it's like why do we care.

01:45:02.130 --> 01:45:12.108
Well okay turn machines are good start because you can kind of see that sort of mechanically doing things but when we actually start thinking about computers Computing things we have a really good reason to care.

01:45:12.195 --> 01:45:23.513
And this is sort of what we're what we're providing I think is a reason to care about a lot of these areas of mathematical physics so that's been that's been very nice so I'm not sure we've ever got to the.

01:45:23.691 --> 01:45:28.960
The question of why does the universe know this little let's let's let's talk about that yes so weird.

01:45:29.029 --> 01:45:41.860
It's not the simplest question in the world so so it's it takes a few steps to get to it and it's nevertheless even surprising that you can even begin to answer this question and Daisy was saying I'm very surprised.

01:45:42.523 --> 01:45:47.783
So the next thing to perhaps understand is this idea of rule space.

01:45:48.051 --> 01:45:54.067
So we've got kind of physical space we've got bronchial space the space of possible Quantum histories.

01:45:54.199 --> 01:46:04.122
And now we've got another level of kind of abstraction which is Rule space and hears that his where that comes from so you say okay you say we've got

01:46:04.057 --> 01:46:14.682
this model for the universe we've got a particular Rule and we run this Rule and we get the universe okay so that's that's interesting why that rule why not another rule.

01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:20.435
So that confused me for a long time then I realized well actually what if.

01:46:20.675 --> 01:46:29.473
The thing could be using all possible rules whatever at every step in addition to saying apply a particular rule at all places in this type of graph.

01:46:29.596 --> 01:46:35.783
One could say just take all possible rules and apply all possible rules at all plus more places than the side program.

01:46:35.997 --> 01:46:44.210
Okay and then you make this rule multi-way graph which both is or possible histories for a particular Rule and all possible rules,

01:46:44.261 --> 01:46:53.725
so the next thing you'd say is how can you get anything reasonable out how can anything you know Real come out of the set of all possible rules applied in all possible ways.

01:46:53.830 --> 01:47:04.429
Okay there's a subtle thing so which I haven't fully untangled the there is this object which is the result of running all possible rules in all possible ways.

01:47:04.507 --> 01:47:10.866
And you might say if you're running all possible rules why can't everything possible happen well the answer is because.

01:47:10.953 --> 01:47:23.450
When you the sort of this entanglement that occurs so let's say that you have a lot of different possible initial conditions a lot of different possible States then you're applying these different rules.

01:47:23.682 --> 01:47:27.340
Well some of those rules can end up with the same state.

01:47:27.481 --> 01:47:36.090
So it isn't the case that you can just get from anywhere to anywhere there's this whole entangled structure of what can lead to what and there's a definite structure that's produced.

01:47:36.411 --> 01:47:42.310
I think I'm going to call that definite structure the Rulli add the limit of the limits of kind of,

01:47:42.344 --> 01:47:52.357
all possible rules being applied in all possible ways you saying that structure is finite so that somehow connects to maybe similar kind of thing is like causal and variance

01:47:52.219 --> 01:48:01.260
well there have been truly odd necessarily has caused one variants that's a feature of that's just a mathematical consequence of essentially using all possible rules

01:48:01.086 --> 01:48:03.483
plus Universal computation

01:48:03.274 --> 01:48:13.152
gives you the fact that for many Divergent pause you can always the past will always convert does that say that the rule is that necessarily infer that the rule e ad is.

01:48:13.311 --> 01:48:18.760
Finite in the end it's not necessarily finite I mean it's a it's a

01:48:18.641 --> 01:48:32.345
the just like the history of the universe may not be finite list of the universe time may keep going forever you can keep running the computations of the rule yard and you'll keep spewing out more and more and more structure it's like time doesn't have to end

01:48:32.306 --> 01:48:42.013
it's some that but the issue is there are there are three limits that happen in this really odd object one is how long you run the computation for.

01:48:42.092 --> 01:48:52.006
Another is how many different rules you're applying another is how many different states you start from and the mixture of those three limits I mean this is just mathematically.

01:48:52.129 --> 01:48:53.293
Horrendous.

01:48:53.984 --> 01:49:07.346
And what's interesting about this object is the one thing that does seem to be the case about this object is it connects with ideas and higher category Theory and in particular it connects to some of the 20th Century's most abstract mathematics.

01:49:07.478 --> 01:49:09.299
Done by this chop growth indeed.

01:49:09.522 --> 01:49:22.280
Um ghost and each had a thing called Infinity group Boyd which is closely related to this really odd object although the details the relationship you know I don't fully understand yet.

01:49:22.656 --> 01:49:30.553
I think that the what's interesting is this thing that is sort of this very limiting object so so okay so a way to think about this that that again,

01:49:30.578 --> 01:49:37.881
will take us into another Direction which is the equivalence between physics and Mathematics the way that.

01:49:38.356 --> 01:49:43.480
Well let's see maybe this is just to give a sense of this kind of.

01:49:43.595 --> 01:49:53.230
Groupoid and things like that you can think about in mathematics you can think you have certain axioms they're kind of like atoms and you well actually let's say.

01:49:53.714 --> 01:50:02.566
Let's talk about mathematics for a second so what is mathematics what is what is it made of so-to-speak mathematics there's a bunch of statements like

01:50:02.446 --> 01:50:11.937
for Edition X Plus Y is equal to Y plus X that's a statement of mathematics another statement will be you know x squared minus 1 is equal to X Plus 1 x minus 1

01:50:11.763 --> 01:50:20.894
there are infinite number of these possible statements in mathematics is that I mean it's not just a guess a statement but with X Plus y it's a rule that you can

01:50:20.801 --> 01:50:29.258
you think of it as a rule it's a it is a it is a rule it's also just a thing that is true in mathematics right,

01:50:29.309 --> 01:50:31.111
the statement of Truth okay right.

01:50:31.244 --> 01:50:41.555
And what you can imagine is you you imagine just laying out this giant kind of ocean of all all statements well actually you first start okay this is where.

01:50:41.678 --> 01:50:51.484
This was segueing into a different thing let me let me not go in this direction for us that's not go to metamathematics just yeah will maybe get to metamathematics but it's some

01:50:51.346 --> 01:50:59.721
so let me not let me explain the group I'd and things later yes but but so let's come back to the universe always a good place to

01:50:59.574 --> 01:51:11.793
bien Sur is the what is the universe has to do with the rule we add the really all space and how that's possible leak connected to why the thing exists at all and why there's we just one of them

01:51:11.646 --> 01:51:18.527
yes okay so here's the point so the thing that had confused me for a long time was let's say we get.

01:51:18.605 --> 01:51:24.829
The rule for the universe we hold it in our hands we said this is our universe then the immediate question is why isn't another one.

01:51:25.267 --> 01:51:35.424
And you know that's kind of the you know the sort of the lesson of Copernicus says we're not very special so how come we got Universe number 312

01:51:35.277 --> 01:51:44.498
not Universe quadrillion quadrillion quadrillion and I think the resolution of that is the realization that there that the universe.

01:51:44.622 --> 01:51:53.438
Is running all possible rules so then you say well how on Earth do we perceive the universe to be running according to a particular rule,

01:51:53.498 --> 01:52:03.907
how do we perceive definite things happening in the universe well it's the same story it's the Observer there is a reference frame that we are picking in this rule space.

01:52:04.111 --> 01:52:05.600
And that is what

01:52:05.534 --> 01:52:20.021
determines our perception of the universe with our particular sensory information and so on we are parsing the universe in this particular way so here's the way to think about it in physical space we live in a particular place in the universe.

01:52:20.136 --> 01:52:27.259
And you know we could live at Alpha Centauri but we don't we live here and similarly in rule space.

01:52:27.337 --> 01:52:41.609
We could live in many different places in rural space but we happen to live here and what does it mean to live here it means we have certain sensory input we have certain ways to parse the universe those are our interpretation of the universe.

01:52:41.696 --> 01:52:44.264
What would it mean to travel in real space.

01:52:44.424 --> 01:52:57.417
What it basically means is that we are successively interpreting the universe in different ways so in other words to be at a different point in real space is to have a different in a sense of different interpretation of what's going on in the universe.

01:52:57.486 --> 01:53:01.378
And we can imagine even things like an analog of the speed of light.

01:53:01.474 --> 01:53:08.480
As the maximum speed of translation in real space and so on the way what's the interpretation.

01:53:08.694 --> 01:53:21.057
It's a real space with and we is I'm confused by the we and the interpretation and the Universe I thought moving about and Rule space changes the way the universe.

01:53:21.198 --> 01:53:23.208
Is is.

01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:34.479
The the way we would perceive it the way that they'll so he's ultimately has to do with the perception so it doesn't real rule your space is not somehow changing.

01:53:34.584 --> 01:53:43.904
Like branching into another Universe something like that no I mean part of the points is the the whole point of this is the rule yard is sort of.

01:53:44.091 --> 01:53:54.041
The encapsulated version of everything that is the universe running according to all possible we think of our universe the observable universe.

01:53:54.245 --> 01:54:03.241
As thing so we're a little bit loose with the word Universe then because I wouldn't the really add a potentially encapsulate.

01:54:03.590 --> 01:54:08.183
Very large number like combinatorially large may be infinite.

01:54:08.316 --> 01:54:23.262
Set of what we fit human physicists think of as universes that's an interesting interesting parsing of the wood Universe right because what we're saying is just as we're at a particular place in physical space were at a particular place in rural space.

01:54:23.494 --> 01:54:34.713
That particular place in real space our experience of the universe is this yeah just as if we lived at the center of the Galaxy our universe our experience of the universe will be different from the one that is given where we actually live.

01:54:34.872 --> 01:54:40.051
And so in a what was saying is our when you might say

01:54:40.013 --> 01:54:49.855
I mean in a sense this this really odd is sort of a super universe so to speak but it's all entangled together it's not like you can separate out you can say let me

01:54:49.717 --> 01:54:56.148
it's like when we take a referent okay it's like our experience the universe is based on where we are in the universe.

01:54:56.244 --> 01:55:01.990
We could imagine moving to somewhere else in the universe but it's still the same universe so there's not like universes.

01:55:03.275 --> 01:55:13.261
Existing in parallel no because because the whole point is that if we were able to change our interpretation of what's going on.

01:55:13.483 --> 01:55:18.203
We could perceive a different reference frame in this rule yard

01:55:18.137 --> 01:55:31.410
yeah but that's not that's not that's just yeah that's the same really add that's the same universe you're just moving about these just coordinates and but it looks so so the way that's the reason that's interesting is.

01:55:31.677 --> 01:55:40.277
Imagine the Extraterrestrial intelligence so the alien intelligence we should say the alien intelligence might live on Alpha Centauri

01:55:40.265 --> 01:55:54.671
but it might also live at a different place in real space it can live right here on Earth it's just has a different reference frame that is includes a very different perception of the universe right and then because that really all space is very large.

01:55:54.948 --> 01:56:03.629
I mean do we get to communicate with them right that's yeah but it's also well one thing is how.

01:56:03.806 --> 01:56:10.020
Different the perception of the universe could be I think this could be bizarrely.

01:56:10.405 --> 01:56:16.592
Unimaginably completely different and I mean one thing to realize is even in kind of.

01:56:16.742 --> 01:56:28.817
Things I don't understand well you know I'm I know about the kind of Western tradition of understanding you know science and all that kind of thing and you know you talk to people who say well I you know I'm really into

01:56:28.670 --> 01:56:35.073
some you know Eastern tradition of this that and the other and it's really obvious to me what how things work.

01:56:35.269 --> 01:56:42.807
I don't understand at all but you know it is not obvious I think with this kind of realization that there's these very different,

01:56:42.858 --> 01:56:49.945
ways to interpret what's going on in the universe that kind of gives me at least State doesn't help me to understand that different interpretation,

01:56:49.979 --> 01:57:04.304
but it gives me at least more respect for the possibility that there will be other interpretations yeah it humbles you to the possibility that like what is it reincarnation or all these like Eternal recurrence with niches like just these ideas,

01:57:04.346 --> 01:57:05.285
yeah.

01:57:05.381 --> 01:57:16.367
Well you know the thing that I realized about a bunch of those things is that you know I've been sort of doing my little survey of the history of philosophy just trying to understand you know what can I actually say now about some of these things.

01:57:16.463 --> 01:57:30.050
And you realize that some of these Concepts like the immortal Soul concept which you know I remember when I was a kid and you know it was kind of a lots of religion bashing type stuff with people saying you know what we know about physics,

01:57:30.102 --> 01:57:37.576
tell us how much does a soul way and people are like well how can it be a thing if it doesn't weigh anything.

01:57:37.682 --> 01:57:44.796
Well now we understand you know there is this notion of what's in brains that isn't the matter of brains and it's something computational.

01:57:44.937 --> 01:57:56.661
And there is a sense and in fact it is correct that it is in some sense in Mortal because this pattern of computation is something abstract that is not specific to the particular material of a brain

01:57:56.559 --> 01:57:58.660
now we don't know how to extract it

01:57:58.549 --> 01:58:11.128
you know in our traditional scientific approach but it's still something where it isn't a crazy thing to say there is something doesn't weigh anything that's a kind of a silly question how much does it weigh

01:58:11.017 --> 01:58:17.015
well actually maybe it isn't such a silly question and I model of physics Because the actual computational activity.

01:58:17.111 --> 01:58:27.061
Has has a consequence for gravity and things but that's a very special you because the first talk about mass and energy and so on there could be a what would you call a solar Tron.

01:58:27.761 --> 01:58:34.678
Yes yes yes particle that somehow contains sonus yeah right well that's what by the way

01:58:34.477 --> 01:58:47.056
that's what leibnitz said and you know one thing I've never understood this you know leibniz had this letter of monads and monod ology and he had this idea that that what exists in the universe is this big collection of monads and that they

01:58:46.837 --> 01:58:51.206
that the only thing that one knows about the monads are sort of how they relate to each other

01:58:51.194 --> 01:58:59.623
sounds awfully like hypergraphs right and but leibnitz had really lost me at the following thing he said each of these monads has a soul.

01:58:59.809 --> 01:59:09.238
Each of them has a Consciousness and it's like okay I'm out of here I don't understand this at all I don't know what's going on but I realized recently that in his day

01:59:09.091 --> 01:59:23.425
the concept that a thing could do something could spontaneously do something that was his only way of describing that and so what I would now say is well as this just abstract rule that runs to leibnitz that would have been

01:59:23.287 --> 01:59:29.141
you know in 1690 or whatever that would have been kind of well it has a soul that has a consciousness.

01:59:29.265 --> 01:59:39.269
And so you know in a sense it's like one of these there's no new idea Under the Sun so to speak that's the you know that's a sort of a version of the same kinds of ideas but couched in terms

01:59:39.122 --> 01:59:49.063
that are sort of bizarrely different from the ones that we would use today would you be able to maybe play Devil's Advocate on the your conception of Consciousness that,

01:59:49.070 --> 01:59:58.120
like the two characteristics of it there is constrained and there's a single thread of time is it possible the leibniz was onto something that.

01:59:58.648 --> 02:00:00.586
The basic atom

02:00:00.566 --> 02:00:15.305
the screen Adam of space has a Consciousness is that so these are just words right but what is there is there some sense where Consciousness is much more fundamental than you're making it seem don't know

02:00:15.302 --> 02:00:20.040
I mean the you know I think can you construct the world in which it is much more fundamental.

02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:26.080
I think that okay so the question would be is there a way to think about kind of.

02:00:26.231 --> 02:00:31.518
If we sort of parse the universe down at the level of atoms of space or something.

02:00:31.587 --> 02:00:40.133
Could we say well so that's really a question of a different point of view a different place in real space were asking you're asking a question could that be a civilization,

02:00:40.193 --> 02:00:49.072
that exists could there be sort of conscious entities that exist at the level of atoms of space and what would that be like,

02:00:49.106 --> 02:00:56.590
and I think that comes back to this question of can we you know what's it like to be a cellular automaton type thing I mean it's you know I'm.

02:00:56.704 --> 02:01:04.673
I'm not yet they're like I don't know I mean I think that the this is a I don't even know yet quite,

02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:15.026
how to think about this and the sense that I was considering you know I'm never write fiction but I haven't written it since I was like 10 years old my fiction I made one attempt which I sent to some

02:01:14.861 --> 02:01:31.806
science fiction writer friends of mine and they told me it was terrible so the but this is a long time ago no it was recently recently they said it was terrible that be interesting to see you write a short story based on what sounds like it's already inspiring short stories by or stories yeah right science fiction writers

02:01:31.641 --> 02:01:35.038
but I think the interesting thing for me is.

02:01:35.233 --> 02:01:49.081
You know in the what does it what is it like to be a whatever yeah how do you describe that I mean it's like that's not a thing that you described in mathematics that what is it like to be such and such what's he to me when you say what is it like to be something.

02:01:49.232 --> 02:01:55.383
Presumes that you're talking about a singular entity so yeah.

02:01:55.587 --> 02:02:05.384
Like there's a some kind of feeling of the entity the stuff that's inside of it and the stuff that's outside of it.

02:02:05.607 --> 02:02:11.452
And then that's when Consciousness starts making sense but but then.

02:02:12.026 --> 02:02:21.940
It seems like that could be generalizable if you take some subset of a cellular automata you could start talking about what does that subset.

02:02:22.117 --> 02:02:31.833
Maybe feel but then you can I think you can just take arbitrary numbers of subsets like that to me like you and I.

02:02:32.335 --> 02:02:39.377
I individually our consciousnesses but you could also say the two of us together is a singular conscious Maybe.

02:02:39.447 --> 02:02:46.498
Maybe I'm not so sure about that I think that the single thread of time thing may be pretty important and that as soon as you start saying

02:02:46.351 --> 02:02:58.012
there are two different threads of time there are two different experiences and then we have to say how do they relate how they sort of entangled with each other I mean that may be a different story of a thing that isn't much like.

02:02:58.117 --> 02:03:08.112
You know the what do the ants you know what's it like to be an aunt you know where there's a sort of more Collective view of the world so to speak I don't know I think that

02:03:08.011 --> 02:03:11.849
I mean this is you know

02:03:11.747 --> 02:03:19.923
I don't really have a good I mean my best thought is you know can we turn it into a human story it's like the question of

02:03:19.831 --> 02:03:28.080
you know when we try and understand physics can we turn that into something which is sort of a human understandable narrative and now what's it like to be a such and such.

02:03:28.176 --> 02:03:39.530
You know maybe the only medium in which we can describe that as something like fiction where it's kind of like you're telling you know the life story in that in that in that setting but I'm

02:03:39.402 --> 02:03:46.057
this is this is beyond what I've what I've yet understood how to do yeah but it does seem so like with human consciousness

02:03:46.045 --> 02:03:51.035
you know were made up of cells and like there's a bunch of systems

02:03:50.952 --> 02:03:57.247
the networked that work together that at this at the human level.

02:03:57.343 --> 02:04:11.849
Feel like a single Consciousness when you take yes and so maybe like an ant colonies just too low level sorry an ant is too low level right maybe have to look at the ant colony yeah I agree I could there's some level of which.

02:04:12.026 --> 02:04:15.422
It's a conscious being and then if I go to the planetary scale.

02:04:15.492 --> 02:04:24.784
And maybe that's going too far so there's a nice sweet spot yeah right Consciousness no I mean I agree I think I think the difficulty is that you know.

02:04:24.926 --> 02:04:37.829
Okay so in sort of people who talk about Consciousness yes one of the one of the Terrible Things I've realized because I've now interacted with some of this community so to speak of interesting people who do that kind of thinking but

02:04:37.727 --> 02:04:46.336
you know one of the things I was saying to one of the leading people in that area I was saying you know that you know it must be kind of

02:04:46.279 --> 02:04:58.984
frustrating because it's kind of like a poetry story that is many people writing poems but few people are reading them yes so there are always these different you know everybody has their own Theory Of Consciousness and they are very non inter

02:04:58.982 --> 02:05:02.342
sort of inter discussable and by the way

02:05:02.295 --> 02:05:14.207
I mean you know my own approach to sort of the question of Consciousness as far as I'm concerned I'm an applied Consciousness operative so to speak because I don't really in a sense the thing I'm trying to get out of it,

02:05:14.241 --> 02:05:25.469
his how does it help me to understand what's a possible Theory of physics and how does it help me to say how do I go from this this incoherent collection of things happening in the universe.

02:05:25.601 --> 02:05:36.308
To our definite perception and definite laws and so on and that sort of an applied version of Consciousness and and I think the reason it's sort of segues to a different kind of topic but the reason that.

02:05:36.431 --> 02:05:42.997
One of the things I'm particularly interested in is kind of what's the analog of Consciousness and systems very different from brains.

02:05:43.453 --> 02:05:49.037
And so why is that matter well you know this whole description of this kind of.

02:05:49.106 --> 02:05:58.282
But you know what we haven't talked about why the universe exists so let's let's get to why the universe exists and then we then we can contort about perhaps a little bit about,

02:05:58.307 --> 02:06:07.636
what these models of physics kind of show you about other kinds of things like molecular Computing and so on yes let's good why does the universe exist,

02:06:07.696 --> 02:06:12.173
okay so we finally sort of more or less set the stage we've got this idea of this really odd.

02:06:12.251 --> 02:06:21.598
Of this object that is made from following all possible rules the fact that it's sort of not just this incoherent mess it's got all this entangled structure in it.

02:06:21.686 --> 02:06:30.303
And so on okay so what is this really odd well it is the working out of all possible formal systems.

02:06:30.382 --> 02:06:41.484
So the sort of the question why does the universe exist its core question you kind of started with is you've got to bust two equals four you've got some other abstract results.

02:06:41.644 --> 02:06:51.071
But that's not actualized it's just an abstract thing and when we say we got a model for the universe okay it's this rule you run it and it'll make the universe but it's like.

02:06:51.402 --> 02:06:54.024
But you know where is it actually running.

02:06:54.265 --> 02:07:03.108
What what what is what is it actually doing right what is it actual or is it merely a formal description of something okay.

02:07:03.321 --> 02:07:10.282
So the thing to realize with this with this the thing about the rule yard is it's an inevitable it is.

02:07:10.406 --> 02:07:18.870
The entangled running of all possible rules so you don't get to say it's not like you're saying which truly are you picking.

02:07:19.012 --> 02:07:23.606
Because it's all possible formal rules it's not like it's just.

02:07:23.684 --> 02:07:31.681
You know well actually it's only footnote the only footnote it's an important footnote is it's all possible computational rules.

02:07:31.804 --> 02:07:41.232
Not hyper computational rules that is it's running all the rules that would be accessible to a turing machine.

02:07:41.473 --> 02:07:49.892
But is not running all the rules that will be accessible to a thing that can solve problems in finite time that would take a turing machine infinite time to solve.

02:07:50.151 --> 02:08:01.947
So you can even Alan Turing knew this that you could make oracle's for Turing machines where you say a turing machine can't solve the halting problem for Turing machines it can't know what will happen in any turing machine after an infinite time.

02:08:02.088 --> 02:08:15.648
In any finite time but you could invent a box just make a black box you say I'm going to sell you an oracle that will just tell you you press this button it will tell you what the turing machine will do after an infinite time you can imagine such a box.

02:08:15.762 --> 02:08:24.947
You can't necessarily build one in the physical universe but you can imagine such a box and so we could say well in addition to so in this really add we're imagining

02:08:24.945 --> 02:08:34.769
that there is a computational that at the end it's running rules that our computational it doesn't have a bunch of Oracle black boxes in it.

02:08:35.099 --> 02:08:39.990
You say well why not Well turns out if their article black boxes.

02:08:40.095 --> 02:08:50.621
The Rulli add that is you can make a sort of super really odd that contains those Oracle black boxes but it has a cosmological Event Horizon relative to the first one they can't communicate.

02:08:50.997 --> 02:08:58.760
In other words you can you can end up with what you end up happening what ends up happening is it's like in the physical universe.

02:08:58.883 --> 02:09:07.456
We in this causal graph that represents the causal relationships of different things you can have an event horizon where there's where the causal graph is disconnected.

02:09:07.624 --> 02:09:21.509
Were the effect here an event Happening Here does not affect an event happening here because there's a disconnection in the course of graph now that's what happens in The Event Horizon and so the what will happen between this kind of the ordinary rule yard,

02:09:21.569 --> 02:09:31.339
and the hyper Riyadh is there is an event horizon and you know we in our rule yard we'll just never know that,

02:09:31.381 --> 02:09:39.270
that is that that just separate things they're not they're not connected and maybe I've known as standing but just because we can't observe it.

02:09:40.131 --> 02:09:43.141
Why does that mean it doesn't exist.

02:09:43.255 --> 02:09:53.377
So you it might exist but it does it's not clear what it it's so what so to speak whether it exists you know what we're trying to understand is why does our universe exist.

02:09:53.617 --> 02:09:57.626
We're not trying to ask the question what you know it's.

02:09:58.100 --> 02:10:12.579
Let me say another thing I mean make a meta comment okay which is that that I have not thought through this hyper really ad business properly so I'm I can't the the hyper really add is referring to.

02:10:12.747 --> 02:10:21.590
I really had in which hyper computation as possible that's correct okay so like what the that footnote the footnote to the footnote.

02:10:22.046 --> 02:10:24.939
Is we're not sure why.

02:10:25.008 --> 02:10:35.273
This is important yeah that's right so let's ignore that okay it's already abstract enough okay so so okay so the one question is.

02:10:36.009 --> 02:10:46.994
We have to say if we're saying why does the universe exist one question is why is it this universe and Not Another Universe yeah okay so the important point about this really odd idea.

02:10:47.090 --> 02:10:51.946
Is that it's in the really odd are all possible formal systems.

02:10:52.024 --> 02:10:58.094
So there's no choice being made there's no there's no like oh we picked this particular universe and not that one,

02:10:58.145 --> 02:11:07.447
that's the first thing the second thing is the that we have to ask the question so so you say why does two plus two equals four exist.

02:11:08.039 --> 02:11:17.035
That's not really a that is a thing that necessarily is that way just on the basis of the meaning of the terms 2 and plus some equals and so on

02:11:16.915 --> 02:11:21.329
so the thing is that this this really odd object

02:11:21.209 --> 02:11:31.105
is in a sense a necessary object it is just the thing that is the consequence of working out the consequence of the formal definition of things

02:11:30.967 --> 02:11:39.072
you don't it is not a thing where you're saying and this is picked as the particular thing this is just something which necessarily.

02:11:39.222 --> 02:11:48.930
Is that thing because of the definition of what it means to have computations is there really a it's a formal system yes.

02:11:49.710 --> 02:11:55.852
But does it exist ah well where are we in this whole thing.

02:11:56.309 --> 02:12:05.701
We are part of this really hard and so our so there is no sense to say does two plus two equals four exist

02:12:05.653 --> 02:12:15.126
well that's that's in some sense it necessarily exists it's a necessary object it's not a thing that way you can ask

02:12:14.934 --> 02:12:32.392
you know it's usually in philosophy there's a sort of Distinction made between you know necessary tools contingent truths analytic proposition synthetic propositions are a variety of different versions of this the things which are necessarily true just based on the definition of terms.

02:12:32.471 --> 02:12:36.443
And there are things which happen to be true in our universe but.

02:12:36.558 --> 02:12:48.570
What weird we don't exist in real space we that's one of the coordinates that Define our existence right okay so yes yes but this really add is

02:12:48.540 --> 02:12:56.708
the set of all possible rule coordinates so what we're saying is it contains that so what we're saying is we exist,

02:12:56.759 --> 02:13:10.472
okay so our perception of what's going on is where the particular place in this rule yard and we are concluding certain things about how the universe works based on that but the question is do we understand you know

02:13:10.460 --> 02:13:16.099
is there something where we say so why is it work that way.

02:13:16.375 --> 02:13:21.239
Well the answer is I think it has to work that way because.

02:13:21.398 --> 02:13:28.126
This there isn't this really odd it's a necessary object in the sense that it is a purely formal.

02:13:28.375 --> 02:13:36.507
Just like two plus two equals four it's not an object that was made of something it's an object that is just an expression of.

02:13:36.594 --> 02:13:45.086
The necessary collection of formal relations that exist and so then the issue is can we in our experience of that.

02:13:45.299 --> 02:13:59.660
Is it you know can we have tables and chairs so to speak in that just by virtue of our experience of that necessary thing and you know what people have generally thought and honestly that I don't know of a lot of.

02:13:59.802 --> 02:14:03.873
Discussion of this why does the universe exist question it's been a very.

02:14:04.411 --> 02:14:16.549
I've been surprised actually at how little I mean I think it's one of these things that really kind of far out there but the thing that that is you know the surprise here is that.

02:14:16.627 --> 02:14:18.700
All possible formal rules.

02:14:18.923 --> 02:14:28.792
When you run them together and that's the critical thing when you run them together they produce this kind of entangled structure that has a definite structure it's not just.

02:14:28.924 --> 02:14:34.500
You know a random arbitrary thing it's a thing with definite structure and that structure.

02:14:34.596 --> 02:14:44.060
Is the thing when we are embedded in that structure when when anything they an entity embedded in that structure perceives something which is.

02:14:44.219 --> 02:14:52.540
Then we can interpret as physics and things like this so in other words we don't have to ask the question the the why does it exist,

02:14:52.555 --> 02:14:59.633
it necessarily exist I'm missing this part why doesn't necessarily say okay okay let me know thank you need to have a.

02:14:59.757 --> 02:15:10.373
If you want to formalize the relation between entities but why did why do you need to have relations okay okay so so.

02:15:10.434 --> 02:15:18.170
Let's say you say well it's like why does math have to exist.

02:15:18.626 --> 02:15:26.280
Okay that's the first question yeah okay fair question let's see I think the thing to think about is.

02:15:26.485 --> 02:15:31.988
The existence of mathematics is something we're given a definition of terms.

02:15:32.957 --> 02:15:36.804
What follows from that definition inevitably follows.

02:15:37.314 --> 02:15:43.655
So now you can say why Define any terms but in a sense the.

02:15:44.786 --> 02:15:52.828
Well that's okay so the definition of terms I mean I think the way to think about this let me see so like.

02:15:53.005 --> 02:16:01.317
Concrete terms the stakes in Crete I mean that just things like you know.

02:16:01.873 --> 02:16:05.530
Logical or righty but that's the thing.

02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:15.622
That's a powerful thing well it's just yes okay but it's a the point is that it is not a thing of our you know people imagine there is I don't know

02:16:15.610 --> 02:16:22.599
the you know an elephant or something or the you know elephants are presumably not

02:16:22.542 --> 02:16:31.295
necessary objects they are they happen to exist as a result of kind of biological evolution and whatever else but the

02:16:31.238 --> 02:16:39.514
the thing is that in some sense that there is it is a different kind of thing to say does plus exist.

02:16:39.664 --> 02:16:48.219
The not it's not like an elephant so plus is seems more fundamental more basic than an elephant yes but.

02:16:48.378 --> 02:16:51.307
You can imagine a world without.

02:16:52.222 --> 02:16:59.391
Plus or anything like it like why do formal things that are discreet that can be used.

02:16:59.478 --> 02:17:07.187
To reason after exist or go well okay so why okay so then the question is but the whole point is.

02:17:07.256 --> 02:17:19.259
Computation we can certainly imagine computation that is we can certainly say there is a formal system that we can construct abstractly in our minds that is computation.

02:17:19.670 --> 02:17:28.297
And that that's the you know we can we can imagine it now the question is is it is.

02:17:28.366 --> 02:17:38.244
That formal system once we exist as observers embedded in that formal system that's enough to have something which is like iuniverse yeah.

02:17:38.404 --> 02:17:45.113
And so then the then what you're kind of asking is perhaps is why I mean.

02:17:45.246 --> 02:17:55.223
The point is we definitely can't imagine it there's nothing that says that we're not saying that there's it sort of inevitable that that.

02:17:55.364 --> 02:18:08.537
Is a thing that we can imagine we don't have to ask does it exist we're just it is definitely something we can imagine now that's then we have this thing that is a formally constructible thing.

02:18:08.634 --> 02:18:16.730
That we can imagine and now we have to ask the question what you know given that formerly constructible thing what is

02:18:16.727 --> 02:18:31.340
what consequences does that with if we were to perceive that for Malika if we were embedded in that formerly constructible thing what will we be perceive about the world and we would say we perceive that the world exists,

02:18:31.364 --> 02:18:41.108
because we we are seeing all of this mechanism of all these things happening and but that's something that is just a feature of it's something where we are.

02:18:41.213 --> 02:18:53.044
See another way of asking this I'm trying to get at I understand why it feels like this rule we add is necessary hmm.

02:18:53.717 --> 02:18:59.004
But maybe it's just me being human but it feels like then.

02:18:59.154 --> 02:19:04.045
You should be able to not us but somehow step outside of the rule yet.

02:19:04.475 --> 02:19:10.842
Like what's outside the rule yet well the really odd is all formal systems so there's nothing.

02:19:11.010 --> 02:19:23.868
Because but that is what everyone would say I know that's what a human would say because we're used to the idea that there there's but the whole point is that by the time it's all possible formal systems it's it's like

02:19:23.839 --> 02:19:31.277
it is all things you can imagine but all computations you can imagine but like we don't.

02:19:31.977 --> 02:19:40.757
Well so what we don't do is that could be other code okay so so that's that's a fact question is it possible to encode are all,

02:19:40.817 --> 02:19:46.392
once we is that something that isn't what we can represent formerly

02:19:46.299 --> 02:19:59.887
right that is that is something that and that's I think related to the hyper rule yard footnote so to speak of them which I'm afraid that the you know one of the things sort of interesting about this is,

02:19:59.893 --> 02:20:05.152
you know there has been some discussion of this in Theology and things like that but,

02:20:05.159 --> 02:20:14.352
which I don't necessarily understand all of but the the key sort of new input is this idea that.

02:20:14.432 --> 02:20:20.736
All possible formal systems it's like you know if you make a world people say well you make a world

02:20:20.697 --> 02:20:31.952
with a particular in a particular way with particular rules but no you don't do that you can make a world that deals with all possible rules and then merely by virtue of

02:20:31.896 --> 02:20:40.972
living in a particular place in that world so to speak we have the perception we have of what the world is like now I have to say the the,

02:20:41.006 --> 02:20:50.902
it's sort of interesting because I've you know I wrote this piece about this and I you know this philosophy stuff is not super easy and I've

02:20:50.783 --> 02:21:04.037
as I'm as I'm talking to you about it and I actually haven't you know people have been interested in lots of different things we've been doing but this why does the universe exists has been I would say one of the one of the ones that you would think people would be most interested in

02:21:03.890 --> 02:21:10.879
but actually I think that just like oh that's just something complicated that so so I haven't

02:21:10.849 --> 02:21:20.132
I haven't explained it as much as I've explained a bunch of other things and I have to say I think I think I may be missing a couple of pieces of that argument that

02:21:20.058 --> 02:21:29.593
would be so so it's kind of a like why you are your conscious being is computationally bounded so you're missing D having written a quite a few.

02:21:29.663 --> 02:21:36.102
Articles yourself you you're now missing some of the pieces yes well being human right.

02:21:36.289 --> 02:21:50.336
One of the consequences of this why the unit why the universe exists thing and this kind of concept of truly adds and and you know places in there representing our perception of the universe and so on one of the weird consequences is.

02:21:50.603 --> 02:21:54.872
If the universe exists mathematics must also exist.

02:21:55.176 --> 02:22:05.873
And that's a weird thing because mathematics people have been very confused including me have been very confused about the the question of kind of what.

02:22:06.033 --> 02:22:12.688
What is the foundation of mathematics what is what kind of a thing is mathematics is mathematics something

02:22:12.604 --> 02:22:21.060
where we just write down axioms like Euclid did for geometry and we just build the structure and we could have written down different accents I mean have a different structure

02:22:21.057 --> 02:22:24.660
or is it something that has a more fundamental sort of truth to it.

02:22:24.865 --> 02:22:35.158
And I have to say is one of these cases where I've long believed that mathematics has a great deal of arbitrariness to it that there are particular axioms that kind of got written down by the Babylonians.

02:22:35.263 --> 02:22:38.786
And you know that's what we've ended up with the mathematics that we have.

02:22:38.864 --> 02:22:53.748
And I have to say actually my my wife has been telling me for 25 years she was a mathematician she's been telling me you're wrong about the foundations of mathematics and you know I'm like no no no I know what I'm talking about and finally she's much more right.

02:22:53.826 --> 02:23:07.682
Then then I've been so it's one of those so I mean her sense and your sense I we just so this is the question of metamathematics so we just kind of uninsured directory through.

02:23:07.761 --> 02:23:19.017
Rule your space except in mathematics through trajectory of certain kind of think that is partly the idea so so I think that the notion is this so 100 years ago little bit more than 100 years ago,

02:23:19.041 --> 02:23:26.821
but people have been doing mathematics for ages but then in the in the late 1800's people decided to try and formalize Mathematics and say

02:23:26.783 --> 02:23:34.860
you know it is mathematics is you know we're going to break it down we're going to make it like logic we're going to make it out of out of sort of fundamental Primitives,

02:23:34.885 --> 02:23:40.307
and that was people like frager and piano and Hilbert and so on and they kind of got this idea

02:23:40.304 --> 02:23:53.775
of let's do kind of Euclid but even better let's just make everything just in terms of this sort of symbolic axioms and then build up mathematics from that and that you know they thought at the time as soon as they get.

02:23:53.889 --> 02:24:02.408
These symbolic axioms that they made the same mistake that kind of computational irreducibility mistake they thought as soon as we've written down the axioms

02:24:02.306 --> 02:24:10.357
then it'll just we'll just have a machine kind of a super Mathematica so to speak that can just grind out all truth in terms of mathematics.

02:24:10.606 --> 02:24:18.764
That got exploded by girdles theorem which is basically the story of computational irreducibility it's that even though you know those underlying rules

02:24:18.762 --> 02:24:28.388
you can't deduce all the consequences in any finite way and so so that was but now the question is okay so they broke mathematics down into these axioms.

02:24:28.485 --> 02:24:34.267
And they say now you build up from that so what I'm increasingly coming to realize is,

02:24:34.318 --> 02:24:38.920
that's similar to saying let's take a gas and break it down into molecules.

02:24:39.197 --> 02:24:50.498
Does gas laws that are the large-scale structure and so on that we humans are familiar with and then there's the underlying molecular Dynamics and I think that the axiomatic level of mathematics,

02:24:50.522 --> 02:24:58.168
which we can access with automated theorem proving and proof assistants and these kinds of things that's the molecular dynamics of mathematics,

02:24:58.201 --> 02:25:06.593
and occasionally we see through to that molecular Dynamics we see undecidability we see other things like this one of the things I've always found very mysterious.

02:25:06.690 --> 02:25:14.939
Is that Google's theorem shows that there are sort of things which cannot be finitely proved in mathematics there are proofs of arbitrary length.

02:25:15.071 --> 02:25:21.042
Infinite length proofs that you might need but in Practical mathematics mathematicians don't typically run into this.

02:25:21.166 --> 02:25:28.802
They just happily go along doing that mathematics and I think what's actually happening is that what they're doing is they're looking at.

02:25:28.935 --> 02:25:38.408
This they are essentially observers in meta mathematical space and they are picking a reference frame in metal mathematical space.

02:25:38.468 --> 02:25:46.915
And they are computationally bounded observers a mathematical space which is causing them to deduce the laws of matter mathematics,

02:25:46.975 --> 02:25:52.019
on the laws of mathematics like the laws of fluid mechanics are much more understandable.

02:25:52.089 --> 02:26:05.873
Done this underlying molecular Dynamics and so what gets really bizarre is thinking about kind of the analogy between metamathematics this idea of of you exist in this kind of.

02:26:06.312 --> 02:26:08.377
In the sort of space of possible.

02:26:08.464 --> 02:26:18.918
In this kind of mathematical space where the where the individual kind of points in the mathematical space are statements in mathematics and they're connected by proofs.

02:26:19.077 --> 02:26:26.443
Well one statement you know you take a couple of different statements you can use those to prove some other statement and you've got this whole network of proofs,

02:26:26.486 --> 02:26:33.178
that's the kind of causal network of mathematics of what can prove what and so on and you can say at any moment

02:26:33.175 --> 02:26:41.252
in the history of mathematician of a single mathematical Consciousness you are in a single kind of slice.

02:26:41.322 --> 02:26:53.873
Of this kind of meta mathematical space you you know a certain set of mathematical statements you can then deduce with proofs you can deduce other ones and so on your kind of gradually moving through matter mathematical space.

02:26:54.015 --> 02:26:58.609
And so it's kind of the view is that the reason that mathematicians

02:26:58.498 --> 02:27:13.067
perceive mathematics to have the sort of integrity and lack of kind of undecidability and so on that they do is because they like we as as observers the physical Universe we have these limitations associated with computational boundedness angle for out of time

02:27:12.929 --> 02:27:20.755
Consciousness limitations basically that the same thing is true of mathematicians perceiving sort of meta mathematical space and so what's happening is.

02:27:21.346 --> 02:27:30.080
When you look at if you look at one of these formalized mathematics systems something like you know Pythagoras Theorem it'll be it'll take Co I don't know.

02:27:30.285 --> 02:27:36.103
What is it maybe 10,000 individual little steps to prove Pythagoras Theorem

02:27:36.101 --> 02:27:50.020
I'm one of the bizarre things that's a sort of an empirical fact that I'm trying to understand a little bit better if you look at different proof assist if you look at different formulas mathematics systems they actually have different axioms underneath but they can all proof Pythagoras Theorem.

02:27:50.234 --> 02:28:04.560
And so in other words it's a little bit like what happens with gases we can have air molecules we can have water molecules but they still have fluid dynamics both of them have fluid dynamics and so similarly at the level that mathematics that mathematicians care about mathematics.

02:28:04.620 --> 02:28:07.216
It's way above the macular dinamics so to speak.

02:28:07.537 --> 02:28:19.459
And they're all kinds of weird things like for example one thing I was realizing recently as the quantum theory of mathematics that's a very bizarre idea but basically when you prove what is you know a proof.

02:28:19.663 --> 02:28:32.682
Is you got one statement in mathematics you go through other statements eventually get to a statement you're trying to prove for example that's a pass the path and met a mathematical space and that's a single path a single proof is a single path.

02:28:32.770 --> 02:28:37.967
But you can imagine there are other proofs of the same results there are a bundle of proofs,

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:52.218
that's this whole set of possible prohibit because think of as branching similar to the quantum mechanics model that you were talking about exactly and so and then there's someone variance that you can formalize and then the same way that you can for the quantum mechanical right so the question is in proof space

02:28:52.098 --> 02:28:54.549
you know as you start thinking about multiple proofs,

02:28:54.574 --> 02:29:07.315
although analogs of for example destructive interference of multiple processor has a bizarre idea that's just a couple of days old so it's not not yet fully formed but as you try and do that when you have two different proofs,

02:29:07.339 --> 02:29:19.530
it's like two photons going in different directions you have to proof switch at an intermediate stage are incompatible and that's kind of like destructive interference is it possible for this to instruct the engineering of automated

02:29:19.456 --> 02:29:28.883
proof systems a salute as a practical matter I mean that you know this whole question in fact Jonathan God has a nice heuristic for automated theorem provers

02:29:28.863 --> 02:29:33.718
that's based on our physics project that is looking for essentially using.

02:29:33.859 --> 02:29:42.000
Kind of using energy and in our models energy is kind of level of activity in this hypergraph.

02:29:42.259 --> 02:29:52.001
And so that's sort of a heuristic for automated theorem proving about how do you pick which path to go down that is based on essentially physics.

02:29:52.647 --> 02:30:01.715
I mean the thing that gets interesting about this is is the way that one consider how the interplay between like for example a black hole what is a black hole in metamathematics.

02:30:02.037 --> 02:30:03.237
So the answer is

02:30:03.216 --> 02:30:17.379
what is black hole in physics a black hole in physics is where in the simplest form a black hole time ends that is all you know everything is crunched down to the SpaceTime Singularity and everything just ends up at that singularity.

02:30:17.466 --> 02:30:18.720
So in our models,

02:30:18.754 --> 02:30:32.449
that's a little hard to understand General tivity with continuous mathematics and what is the similarity look like in our models it's something very pragmatic it's just you're applying these rules time is moving forward and then there comes a moment where the rules no rules apply,

02:30:32.473 --> 02:30:42.136
so time stops it's kind of like the universe dies then you know the nothing happens in the universe anymore well in mathematics that's a decidable theory.

02:30:42.250 --> 02:30:48.995
That's a theory so theories which have undecidability which are things like arithmetic set theory all the serious models,

02:30:49.046 --> 02:30:57.663
there is a mathematics they all have the feature that there are proofs of arbitrarily long length in something like Boolean algebra which is a decidable theory.

02:30:57.761 --> 02:31:04.506
There are you know any question in Boolean algebra you can just go crunch crunch crunch and then knowing number of steps you can answer it.

02:31:04.728 --> 02:31:11.401
You know satisfiability you know might be hard but it's still a bounded number of steps to answer any satisfiability problem.

02:31:11.507 --> 02:31:16.677
And so that's the notion of a black hole in physics where time stops.

02:31:16.827 --> 02:31:24.275
That's the that's analogous to in mathematics where there aren't infinite length proofs where when in physics.

02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:38.381
You know you can wander around the universe forever if you don't run into a black hole if you run into a black hole and time stops you're done and it's the same thing in mathematics between decidable decidable theories and undecidable theories that's a it's an example and I think

02:31:38.253 --> 02:31:45.664
we're sort of the temp to understand so another question is kind of what is the what is the general relativity of.

02:31:45.815 --> 02:31:55.135
Of metamathematics what is the bulk theory of matter mathematics so in the literature mathematics there about 3 million theorems that people have published.

02:31:55.375 --> 02:31:56.818
And those represent,

02:31:56.851 --> 02:32:08.493
it's kind of on this it's like like on the earth we would be you know you know we've put cities in particular places on the Earth but yet there is ultimately you know we know the Earth is roughly spherical

02:32:08.491 --> 02:32:17.280
and there's an underlying space and we could just talk about you know the world of space in terms of where our cities happened to be but there's actually an underlying space.

02:32:17.368 --> 02:32:31.233
And so the question is what's that for metamathematics and as we kind of explore what is for example for mathematics which is always likes taking some abstract limits so an obvious abstract limit for mathematics to take is the limit of the future of.

02:32:31.600 --> 02:32:39.300
That is it will be you know the ultimate structure of mathematics yeah and one of the things that's an empirical observation about mathematics,

02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:48.364
that's quite interesting is that a lot of theories in one area of mathematics algebraic geometry or something might have they play into another area of mathematics.

02:32:48.705 --> 02:32:58.628
That same the same kind of fundamental construct seem to occur in very different areas of mathematics and that structurally captured a bit with category Theory and things like that.

02:32:58.787 --> 02:33:08.142
But I think that there's probably an understanding of this matter mathematical space that will explain why different areas of mathematics ultimately sort of map into the same thing,

02:33:08.194 --> 02:33:14.840
and I mean my little challenge to myself is what's time dilation in mathematics.

02:33:14.946 --> 02:33:26.273
Other words as you as you basically As you move around in this mathematical space of possible statements you know what's how does that moving around it's basically what's happening is.

02:33:26.892 --> 02:33:35.050
As you move around in the space of mathematical statements it's like you're changing from algebra geometry to whatever else and you're trying to prove the same theorem

02:33:34.949 --> 02:33:38.813
but as you try if you keep on moving to these different places,

02:33:38.829 --> 02:33:50.660
it's slower to prove that theorem because you keep on having to translate what you're doing yeah back to where you started from and that's kind of the beginnings of the analog of time dilation amount of mathematics plus there's probably fractional dimensions in this space as well.

02:33:50.991 --> 02:33:58.439
The space is a very messy space the space is much messier than physical space I mean even in even in the models of physics.

02:33:58.517 --> 02:34:03.380
Physical space is very tame compared to bronchial space and Royal space.

02:34:03.468 --> 02:34:12.184
I mean the mathematical structure bronze Shields space probably more like Hilbert space but it's a rather complicated Hilbert space and Rule space.

02:34:12.525 --> 02:34:22.457
Is more like this weird Infinity groupoid story of growth and Deacon and I can explain that a little bit because in you know in mathematical space.

02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:26.166
A apothem medical articles basis of is a,

02:34:26.208 --> 02:34:39.110
a path between two statements as a way to get by proofs is to way to find a proof that goes from one statement to another and so one of the things you can do you can think about is you've got between statements you've got proofs.

02:34:39.252 --> 02:34:46.880
They are pause between statements okay so now you can go to the next level and you can ask what about a mapping from one proof to another.

02:34:47.255 --> 02:35:00.069
And so that's in in category Theory that's kind of a higher category that notion of higher categories where your you're mapping not just between not just between objects but you're mapping between the mappings between objects and so on.

02:35:00.318 --> 02:35:06.910
And so you can keep doing that and you keep saying higher-order proofs I want mappings between proofs between proofs and so on.

02:35:06.997 --> 02:35:17.380
And that limiting structure oh by the way one thing that's very interesting is Imagine improve space you've got these two proofs and the question is what is the topology of proof space.

02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:19.567
In other words if you take these two paws

02:35:19.492 --> 02:35:27.958
can you continuously deform them into each other or is there some big hole in the middle that prevents you from continuously deforming them one into the other it's kind of like

02:35:27.847 --> 02:35:42.046
you know when you when you think about some I don't know some puzzle for example you're moving pieces around on some puzzle and you can think about the space of possible states of the puzzle and you can make this graph that shows from one state of the puzzle to another state of the puzzle and so on

02:35:41.917 --> 02:35:51.723
and sometimes you can easily get from one state to any other state but sometimes they'll be a hole in that space and they'll be you know you always have to go around the Securitas route.

02:35:51.802 --> 02:36:04.461
To get from here to that there won't be any direct way that's kind of a question of whether there is sort of an obstruction in the space and so the question is improve space What is the what are.

02:36:04.558 --> 02:36:16.660
You know what does it mean if there's an obstruction in proof space yeah I don't even know what an obstruction means improved space because 40 be an obstruction should be reachable some other way from some other place.

02:36:16.909 --> 02:36:20.332
Well this is like on an unreachable part of the graph.

02:36:20.546 --> 02:36:30.919
No it's not just an unreachable part it's a part where there are paths that go one way there are parts that go the other way and this question of Home atop in mathematics is this question can you continuously deform.

02:36:31.016 --> 02:36:39.903
You know from one path to another path or do you have to go in a jump so to speak so okay so it's like that if you're going around a sphere for example if you're going around us I don't know.

02:36:40.045 --> 02:36:42.990
A cylinder or something you can wind around one way.

02:36:43.052 --> 02:36:51.157
And you can there's no the paths where you can where you can easily deform One path into another because it's just sort of sitting on the same side of the cylinder

02:36:51.010 --> 02:37:02.040
but when you've got something that wins all the way around a cylinder you can't continuous the deform that down to a point because it's stuck wrapped around my intuition about proof spaces you should be able to deform it I mean that

02:37:01.902 --> 02:37:11.655
because then otherwise it doesn't make sense because if the topology matters of the way you move about the space that I don't even know what that means well what it would mean is

02:37:11.616 --> 02:37:19.360
that you would have one way of doing a proof of something over here in algebra and another way of doing a proof of something over here in geometry.

02:37:19.574 --> 02:37:27.688
And there would not be an intermediate way to map between those proofs for how would that be possible if they start at the same place and the same place.

02:37:28.126 --> 02:37:39.570
Well it's the same thing as you know we've got points on a you know if we've got paws on a cylinder now I understand how it works in physical space but it just doesn't it feels like proof space shouldn't have that

02:37:39.559 --> 02:37:48.302
okay I mean I'm not sure I don't know we'll know very soon because we get to do some experiments this is the great thing about this stuff is that in fact

02:37:48.156 --> 02:37:55.684
you know I'm in the next few days I hope to do a bunch of experiments on this so you're playing like proofs and in this kind of space yes

02:37:55.637 --> 02:37:58.187
yes I mean so this is toy,

02:37:58.193 --> 02:38:08.062
you know theories and you know we've got good so this kind of segues to perhaps another thing which is this whole idea of multi computation so this this summer.

02:38:08.618 --> 02:38:18.596
Is another kind of bigger idea that so okay this has to do with how do you make models of things and it's going to it's some so.

02:38:18.791 --> 02:38:21.772
I've sort of claim that they've been sort of for epochs,

02:38:21.824 --> 02:38:30.550
in the history of making models of things and and that this multi computation thing is the fourth is a new Epoch what are the first three.

02:38:30.917 --> 02:38:35.376
The first one is is back in Antiquity ancient Greek times.

02:38:35.463 --> 02:38:43.550
People were like what's the universe made of oh it's made of you know everything is water thales you know where everything is made of atoms.

02:38:43.718 --> 02:38:54.280
It's sort of what are things made of or the you know there are these Crystal spheres that represent where the planets are and so on it's like a structural idea of how the universe is constructed.

02:38:54.377 --> 02:38:58.935
There's no real notion of Dynamics is just what is the universe how is the universe made.

02:38:59.364 --> 02:39:06.695
Then we got to the 1600s and we get to the sort of revolution of mathematics being introduced into physics and then.

02:39:07.205 --> 02:39:20.161
We have this kind of idea of you write down some equation the what happens in the universe is the solving of that equation time enters but it's usually just a parameter we just can you know sort of slide it,

02:39:20.195 --> 02:39:26.193
back and forth and say his word is okay then we come to this kind of computational idea.

02:39:26.335 --> 02:39:36.159
That I kind of started really pushing in the in the 90s early 1980s as a result you know the things we were talking about before about complexity that was my motivation,

02:39:36.174 --> 02:39:49.824
but the bigger story was the story of kind of computational models of things and the big difference there from the mathematical models is a mathematical models there's an equation you solve it you go to kind of slide time to the place where you want it,

02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:55.388
in computational models you give the rule and then you just say go run the rule.

02:39:55.520 --> 02:40:03.049
And time is not something you get to slide timers something where it just you run the rule time goes in steps,

02:40:03.109 --> 02:40:12.032
and that's how you work out what how the system behaves you don't time is not just a parameter time is something that is about the running of these of these rules.

02:40:12.138 --> 02:40:15.984
And so there's this computational error disability You Can't Jump Ahead in time,

02:40:16.045 --> 02:40:24.897
but the still important thing is there's still one thread of time it's still the case you know the cellular automaton State then it has the next state and the next state and so on.

02:40:25.047 --> 02:40:34.458
The thing that is kind of with sort of tipped off by quantum mechanics in a sense although it it actually feeds back even entered relativity and things like that that,

02:40:34.491 --> 02:40:40.641
does these multiple threads of time and so in this multi computation Paradigm the kind of idea is,

02:40:40.693 --> 02:40:49.653
instead of that being the single thread of time there are these kind of distributed asynchronous threads of time that are happening and the thing that's sort of different there.

02:40:49.777 --> 02:40:53.786
Is if you want to know what happened if you say what happened in the.

02:40:54.053 --> 02:41:00.581
And the case of the computational Paradigm you just say well after Thousand Steps we got this result.

02:41:00.723 --> 02:41:09.890
But in the multi computational Paradigm after 1000 steps not even clear what 1000 steps means it's got all these different threads of time but there is no state.

02:41:09.978 --> 02:41:19.612
There's all these different possible you know there's all these different paths and so the only way you can know what happened is to have some kind of Observer who is saying here's how to parse.

02:41:19.772 --> 02:41:21.440
The results of what was going on.

02:41:21.573 --> 02:41:32.242
Wrap that observers embedded and they don't have a complete picture so in the case of physics that's right yes and the but that's but so the idea is that in this multi computation setup.

02:41:32.384 --> 02:41:37.212
That it's this idea of these multiple threads of time and models that are based on that.

02:41:37.309 --> 02:41:47.268
And this is similar to what people think about a non-deterministic computation so you have a turing machine usually it has a definite state it follows another state follows another state.

02:41:47.427 --> 02:41:54.451
But typically what people have done when they thought about these kinds of things is they've said well there are all these possible paths a non-deterministic turing machine,

02:41:54.485 --> 02:42:06.470
can follow all these possible paths but we just want one of them we just want the one that's the winner that factors the number or whatever else and similarly and it's the same story in logic programming and so on but we say we've got this goal.

02:42:06.548 --> 02:42:13.978
Find us a path to that goal I just want one path and I'm happy or theorem proving same story I just want one proof and then I'm happy.

02:42:14.335 --> 02:42:19.684
What's happening in multi computation and physics is we actually care about many paths.

02:42:19.889 --> 02:42:28.813
And well there is a case for example probabilistic programming is a version of multi computation in which you're looking at all the paths you just asking for probabilities of things.

02:42:28.964 --> 02:42:38.373
Um but in a sense and physics were taking different kinds of samplings for example in quantum mechanics we're taking a different kind of sampling of all these multiple paths.

02:42:38.686 --> 02:42:48.997
But the thing that is notable is that when you are when you're an observer embedded in this thing etc etc etc with various other sort of footnotes and so on.

02:42:49.129 --> 02:42:56.684
It is inevitable that the thing that you parse out of the system looks like general relativity and quantum mechanics.

02:42:56.925 --> 02:43:01.410
In other words that just by the very structure of this multi computational setup.

02:43:01.786 --> 02:43:10.880
It inevitably is the case that you have certain emergent laws now why is this perhaps not surprising.

02:43:11.139 --> 02:43:15.543
Onyx and statistical mechanics there are sort of inevitable emergent laws.

02:43:15.685 --> 02:43:29.290
Of set of gas dynamics that are independent of the of the details of the molecular Dynamics sort of the same kind of thing but I think what happens is what sort of a funny thing that I just been understanding very recently is.

02:43:29.882 --> 02:43:41.731
When when I kind of introduced this whole sort of computational Paradigm complexity is thing back in the 80s it was kind of like a big Downer because it's like there's a lot of stuff you can't say about what systems will do.

02:43:41.918 --> 02:43:51.418
And then what I realized is and then you might say now we've got multi computation it's even worse you know it doesn't just one thread of time that we can't explain it's all these threads of time we can't explain anything.

02:43:51.722 --> 02:44:00.916
But the following thing happens because there is all this irreducibility and any detailed thing you might want to answer it's very hard to answer.

02:44:01.129 --> 02:44:10.232
But when you have an observer who has certain characteristics like computational boundedness sequentiality of time and so on that Observer.

02:44:10.338 --> 02:44:22.862
Only sample certain aspects of this incredible complexity going on in this multi computational system and that Observer is sensitive only to some underlying core structure of this multi computational system,

02:44:22.914 --> 02:44:28.570
there is all this irreducible computation going on all these details but to that kind of Observer,

02:44:28.622 --> 02:44:37.464
what's important is only the core structure of multi computation which means that Observer observes comparatively simple laws.

02:44:37.588 --> 02:44:45.549
And I think it is inevitable that that Observer observes laws which are mathematically structured like general relativity and quantum mechanics

02:44:45.537 --> 02:44:54.550
which by the way are the same law in our in our model of physics so that's an explanation why there's simple laws that explain a lot for this Observer.

02:44:54.602 --> 02:45:01.932
Potentially yes but what the the place where this gets really interesting is they're all these fields of science.

02:45:01.984 --> 02:45:13.510
What people have kind of gotten stuck where they say we'd really love to have a physics like theory of Economics we'd really love to have a physics like law and Linguistics is that and talk about molecular biology here

02:45:13.426 --> 02:45:22.511
okay so where does multi competition come in for biology economics is super interesting to but biology let's talk about that so let's talk about chemistry for a second

02:45:22.482 --> 02:45:31.712
okay so I mean I have to say you know this is such a weird business for me because you know they're these kind of paradigmatic ideas and then that the actual application

02:45:31.656 --> 02:45:45.009
and it's like I've always said I know nothing about chemistry I learned all the chemistry I know you know the night before some exam when I was 14 years old yeah but I've actually learned a bunch more chemistry and in and Wolfram language these days we have really pretty nice symbolic representation of chemistry

02:45:44.997 --> 02:45:49.519
and in understanding the design of that I've actually I think learn to set them out of chemistry,

02:45:49.525 --> 02:45:57.404
stuff you quiz me on sort of basic high school chemistry I would probably totally fail but but but okay so what is chemistry,

02:45:57.411 --> 02:46:01.581
I mean chemistry is sort of a story of chemical reactions,

02:46:01.624 --> 02:46:14.437
like you've got this particular chemical it's represented as some graph of you know these are these are this configuration of molecules with these bonds and so on and the chemical reaction happens you've got these sort of two graphs,

02:46:14.452 --> 02:46:20.577
they interact in some way you've got another graph for multiple other graphs out so that's kind of the the sort of the,

02:46:20.610 --> 02:46:30.911
the abstract view of what's happening in chemistry and so when you do a chemical synthesis for example you are given certain sort of these are possible reactions that can happen.

02:46:30.972 --> 02:46:33.009
And your ass can you piece together.

02:46:33.078 --> 02:46:44.559
This a sequence of such reactions a sequence of such sort of axiomatic reactions usually called name reactions and chemistry can you piece together a sequence of these reactions so that you get out at the end

02:46:44.493 --> 02:46:49.087
this great molecule you were trying to synthesize and so that's a story very much like theorem proving.

02:46:49.192 --> 02:47:00.501
And people have done actually they start in the 1960s looking at that kind of the theorem proving approach to that although it didn't really it didn't it didn't sort of done too early I think

02:47:00.364 --> 02:47:08.063
but anyway so that's kind of the view is that that chemistry chemical reactions of this story of all these different sort of Paths of possible,

02:47:08.079 --> 02:47:11.170
things that go on okay let's go to an even lower level.

02:47:11.293 --> 02:47:18.939
Let's say instead of asking about which species of molecules were talking about let's look at individual molecules.

02:47:19.044 --> 02:47:26.609
And let's say we're looking at individual molecules and they are having chemical reactions and we're building up this big graph of all these reactions that are happening.

02:47:26.903 --> 02:47:35.116
Okay so so then we've got this big graph and by the way that big graph is incredibly similar to this hypergraph rewriting things.

02:47:35.185 --> 02:47:45.018
In fact in the underlying theory of multi computation there these things we call token event graphs which are basically you've broken your state into tokens,

02:47:45.024 --> 02:47:56.630
like in the case of hypergraph you broken it into hyper edges and each event is just consuming some number of tokens and producing some number of tokens but then you have to there's a lot of work to be done in update rules.

02:47:57.240 --> 02:48:03.553
In terms of what they actually offer chemistry yeah but they are for our observed chemistry yes indeed

02:48:03.479 --> 02:48:11.188
yes indeed we've been working on that actually because we have this beautiful system and Wolfram language for representing chemistry symbolically so we actually have,

02:48:11.221 --> 02:48:19.964
you know this is a this is an ongoing thing to actually figure out what they offer some practical cases does that require human injection or can it be automatically discovered

02:48:19.953 --> 02:48:33.666
these update rules well if we can enable our mystery battery probably discover them automatically but I think in reality right now it's like there are these particular reactions and I really to understand what's going on we're probably going to pick a particular subtype

02:48:33.529 --> 02:48:41.002
of chemistry and just because we let me explain where this is going this is the place that his where this is going so.

02:48:41.595 --> 02:48:50.023
Got this whole network of all these molecules are having all these reactions and so on and this is some whole multi computational story because each.

02:48:50.156 --> 02:48:53.632
Each sort of chemical reaction event.

02:48:53.784 --> 02:49:06.777
Is its own separate event we're saying they all happen asynchronously we're not describing in what order they happen you know maybe that order is governed by some quantum mechanics thing doesn't really matter we're just saying they happen in some order and then we.

02:49:06.873 --> 02:49:16.607
What is the what's the you know how do we think about the system well this thing is some kind of big multi computational system the question is what is the chemical Observer.

02:49:17.009 --> 02:49:22.288
And one possible chemical Observer is all you care about is did you make that particular drug molecule.

02:49:22.375 --> 02:49:29.120
It just asking you know the for the One path another thing you might care about is I want to know the concentration of each species.

02:49:29.181 --> 02:49:43.146
But I want to know you know at every stage I'm going to solve the differential equations that represent the concentrations and I want to know what those all are but there's more because when and it's kind of like you're going below and statistical mechanics.

02:49:43.251 --> 02:49:50.816
That's kind of all these molecules bouncing around and you might say we just going to ignore we're just going to look at the aggregate.

02:49:50.975 --> 02:49:57.711
Densities of certain kinds of molecules but you can look at a lower level you can look at this whole graph a possible interactions.

02:49:57.826 --> 02:50:03.356
And so the kind of the idea would be what you know is the only chemical Observer.

02:50:03.506 --> 02:50:10.468
One who just cares about overall concentrations or can there be a chemical Observer who cares about this network of what happened.

02:50:10.726 --> 02:50:20.397
And so that the question then is so let me give an analogy so this is where I think this is potentially very relevant to molecular molecular biology and molecular computing.

02:50:20.746 --> 02:50:30.255
When we think about a computation usually we say its input its output we you know what chemistry we say there's this input we're going to make this molecule as the out.

02:50:30.837 --> 02:50:39.086
But what if what we actually encode whatever computation what are the thing we care about is some part of this Dynamic Network.

02:50:39.173 --> 02:50:47.215
What if it isn't just the input and output that we care about what if there's some dynamics of the network that we care about now imagine you're a chemical Observer.

02:50:47.410 --> 02:50:50.644
What is the chemical Observer well in molecular biology.

02:50:50.714 --> 02:51:01.619
There are all kinds of weird sorts of observers there are membranes that exist that have you know different kinds of molecules that can bind to them things like this it's not obvious that the

02:51:01.553 --> 02:51:08.153
from a human scale we just measure the concentration of something is the relevant story we can imagine that,

02:51:08.169 --> 02:51:17.633
for example when we look at this whole network of possible reactions we can imagine you know to physical level we can imagine what was the actual momentum direction of that of that molecule,

02:51:17.685 --> 02:51:25.259
what was which we don't pay any attention to when we just talking about chemical concentrations what was the orientation of that molecule these kinds of things.

02:51:25.382 --> 02:51:33.226
And so here's the his the place where I'm have a little suspicion okay so one of the questions in biology is what matters in biology.

02:51:33.511 --> 02:51:42.210
And that is you know we have all these chemical reactions we have all these all these molecular processes going on in you know in biological systems what matters.

02:51:42.504 --> 02:51:44.686
And you know one of the things is.

02:51:44.782 --> 02:51:54.542
To be able to tell what matters well so a big story of the what matters question was what happened in genetics in 1953 when DNA was figured out how DNA worked.

02:51:54.684 --> 02:52:05.967
Because before that time you know genetics have been all these different effects and complicated things and then it was realized ah there's something new a molecule can store information which wasn't obvious before that time,

02:52:06.009 --> 02:52:18.560
a single molecule can store information so there's a place where there can be something important that's happening in microbiology and it's just in the sequence that storing information in a molecule so the possibility now is

02:52:18.504 --> 02:52:20.497
imagine this Dynamic Network.

02:52:20.629 --> 02:52:30.246
This you know causal graphs and multi-way causal graphs and so on that represent all of these different reactions between molecules what if there is some aspect of that,

02:52:30.279 --> 02:52:41.012
that is storing information that's relevant for my field of biology in the dynamic aspect of that yes that's right so that it's similar to how the structure of a DNA molecule.

02:52:41.127 --> 02:52:50.644
Stores information they could be the Dynamics of the system stores information and this kind of process might allow you to give predictions of what that

02:52:50.642 --> 02:52:58.350
would be well yes but we also imagine that you're trying to do for example imagine you're trying to do molecular computation.

02:52:58.600 --> 02:53:06.002
Okay you might think the way we're going to do molecular computation is we're just going to run the thing we're going to see what came out we're going to see what molecule came out.

02:53:06.378 --> 02:53:14.357
This is saying that's not the only thing you can do there is a different kind of chemical Observer that you can imagine constructing which is somehow

02:53:14.309 --> 02:53:24.340
sensitive to this Dynamic Network exactly how that works how we make that measurement I don't know but a few ideas but that's what's important so to speak.

02:53:24.428 --> 02:53:34.387
And that that means and by the way you can do the same thing even for Turing machines you can say if you have a multi way turing machine you can say how do you compute with a multi-way turing machine.

02:53:34.501 --> 02:53:47.061
You cut you can't say well we got this input and this output because the thing has all these threads of time it's got lots of outputs and so then you say well what does it even mean to be a universal multi-way turing machine I don't fully know the answer to that,

02:53:47.122 --> 02:53:55.696
it had an interesting idea freak touring out for sure because then the Dynamics of the the trajectory of the competition matters.

02:53:55.765 --> 02:54:04.571
Yes yes I mean but the thing is that that so this is again a story of what's the Observer so to speak and chemistry what's the Observer there,

02:54:04.623 --> 02:54:12.511
now to give an example of where that might matter very sort of present-day example is in Immunology.

02:54:13.193 --> 02:54:18.722
Well you know we have whatever it is you know ten billion different kinds of antibodies that are

02:54:18.621 --> 02:54:29.372
you know all these different shapes and so on we have I'm a trillion different kinds of T-cell receptors that we can that we produce and you know the traditional theory of Immunology

02:54:29.235 --> 02:54:41.840
is this clonal selection Theory where we are constantly producing randomly producing all these different antibodies and as soon as one of them is binds to an antigen then that one gets Amplified and we produce more of that antibody and so on

02:54:41.694 --> 02:54:50.888
um back in the 1960s I mean ologist called meals you know who is the guy who invented monoclonal antibodies various other things

02:54:50.841 --> 02:55:05.750
kind of had this network theory of the immune system where it will be like what we produce antibodies but then we produce antibodies to the antibodies antibodies and we produce antibodies and we get this whole dynamic network of interactions between different immune system cells.

02:55:06.027 --> 02:55:15.392
And that was that that was kind of a qualitative Theory at that time and it's I've been a little disappointed cuz I've been studying and enology a bit recently,

02:55:15.408 --> 02:55:26.096
and I knew something about this like 35 years ago or something and I knew you know I read a bunch of the books and I talked to a bunch of the people and so on and it was like an emerging theoretical Immunology world.

02:55:26.490 --> 02:55:32.613
And then I look at the books now and they're very thick because they've got you know there's just a ton known about Immunology.

02:55:32.746 --> 02:55:39.069
And you know all these different Pathways all these different details and so on but the theoretical section seemed to have shrunk.

02:55:39.174 --> 02:55:44.227
And so it's some so the question is what,

02:55:44.278 --> 02:55:56.740
you know for example immune memory where is the where does the immune memory reside is it actually some cells sitting in our bone marrow that is you know living for the whole of Our Lives that's going to spring into action as soon as we're showing the same antigen.

02:55:56.863 --> 02:55:59.927
Or is it something different from that is it something more dynamic.

02:56:00.113 --> 02:56:14.475
Is it something more like some network of interactions between these different kinds of immune systems cells and so on and it's known that there are plenty of interactions between T cells and you know there's plenty of Dynamics but what the consequence of that Dynamics is not clear.

02:56:14.580 --> 02:56:18.228
And to have a qualitative theory for that doesn't,

02:56:18.244 --> 02:56:31.191
it doesn't seem to exist in fact I was just just been trying to study this so I'm quite incomplete in my study of these things but I was a little bit taken aback because I've been looking at these things and it's like and then they get to the end where they have the most advanced theory that they've got,

02:56:31.234 --> 02:56:41.616
and it turns out it's a cellular automaton Theory it's like okay well at least I understand that theoria but but you know I think that the possibility is.

02:56:41.685 --> 02:56:43.318
That in numb.

02:56:43.990 --> 02:56:56.299
This is a place where if you want to know you know explain roughly how the immune system works it ends up being the stuff Dynamic Network and then the the you know the immune Consciousness so to speak The Observer.

02:56:56.386 --> 02:57:01.718
Ends up being something that you know in the end it's kind of like does the human get sick or whatever.

02:57:01.995 --> 02:57:14.259
It's a it's something which is a complicated story that relates to this whole sort of dynamic Network and so on and I think that's another place where this kind of notion of where I think multi computation has the possibility.

02:57:14.463 --> 02:57:22.649
See one of the things okay you can end up with something where yes there is a general acidity in that there but it turns up but it may turn out that the Observer.

02:57:22.790 --> 02:57:25.980
Who sees general relativity in the immune system,

02:57:26.013 --> 02:57:33.947
is an observer that's relevant to what we care about about the immune system I mean it could be yes there is some effect where you know there's some you know

02:57:33.926 --> 02:57:42.607
time dilation of T-cells interacting with whatever but it's like that's an effect that's just irrelevant and the thing we actually care about is things about you know.

02:57:42.730 --> 02:57:47.126
What happens when you have a vaccine that goes into some place and shape space and,

02:57:47.168 --> 02:58:00.476
you know how does that affect other places in shape space and how does that spread you know what's the what's the analog of the speed of light and shape space for example that's and that's an important issue if you have one of these Dynamic theories it's like you you know you'll poke into shapes,

02:58:00.527 --> 02:58:09.695
by having you know let's say a vaccine or something that has a particular configuration in shape space how how quickly as this Dynamic Network spreads out.

02:58:09.773 --> 02:58:11.198
How quickly do you get,

02:58:11.240 --> 02:58:20.280
sort of other antibodies in different places and shapes place things like that when you see a shape space in the shape of the molecules or though the and then so this is like.

02:58:20.359 --> 02:58:32.497
Could be deeply connected to the protein and multi protein folding all of that kind of stuff so to be able to say something interesting about the dance of proteins that right exactly then actually has an impact on.

02:58:32.953 --> 02:58:45.028
Helping develop drugs for example or has an impact on biology Immunology helping but I think that's the big thing is you know when we think about molecular biology.

02:58:45.242 --> 02:58:49.908
The you know what what is the qualitative way to think about it,

02:58:49.968 --> 02:58:56.569
in other words is it chemical reaction networks is it you know genetics you know DNA.

02:58:56.719 --> 02:59:05.518
Big you know big news it's kind of there's a digital aspect of the whole thing you know what is the qualitative way to think about how things work in biology.

02:59:05.614 --> 02:59:19.840
You know when we think about I don't know some phenomenon like aging or something there's a big complicated phenomenon which just seems to have all these different tentacles is it really the case that that can be thought about in some you know without DNA when people were describing

02:59:19.792 --> 02:59:25.548
you know genetic phenomena there were you know dominant-recessive this that and the other got very very complicated.

02:59:25.698 --> 02:59:37.502
And then people realize oh it's just you know and what is a gene and so on and so on and so on then people realize it's just base pairs and there's this digital representation and so the question is what is the overarching representation,

02:59:37.518 --> 02:59:43.516
that we can now start to think about using a microbiology I don't know how this will work out and this is again one of these things,

02:59:43.558 --> 02:59:53.410
we're and the place where that gets important is you know maybe molecular biology is doing molecular Computing by using some Dynamic process

02:59:53.380 --> 03:00:08.110
that is something where it is very happily saying oh I just got a result it's in the dynamic structure of this network now I'm going to go and do some other thing based on that result for example but we're like oh I don't know what's going on you know it's just we just measured them levels of these

03:00:08.017 --> 03:00:15.267
chemicals and we couldn't conclude anything but it just we're looking at the wrong thing and so that's the that's kind of the the

03:00:15.147 --> 03:00:23.135
the potential there and it's I mean these things are I don't know it's for me it's like I've not really

03:00:23.123 --> 03:00:28.789
that was not a view I mean I've thought about molecular Computing for ages and ages and ages and I've always imagined,

03:00:28.813 --> 03:00:38.835
that the big story is kind of the original promise of nanotechnology of like can we make a molecular scale Constructor that will just build build a molecule in any shape

03:00:38.751 --> 03:00:45.262
but I don't think I'm now increasingly concluding that's not the big point the big point is something more dynamic

03:00:45.224 --> 03:00:50.097
that will be an interesting endpoint for any of these things but that's perhaps not.

03:00:50.148 --> 03:01:00.116
The thing you know because the one example we have molecular Computing that's really working is US biological organisms and you know maybe the thing that's important there is not,

03:01:00.168 --> 03:01:09.578
this you know what chemicals do you make so to speak but more this kind of dynamic process that Eric process and then you can have a good model like the hyper grafted to then explore.

03:01:10.394 --> 03:01:21.991
What likes simulated again make predictions and if they think just have a way to reason about biology I mean it's hard you know but first of all biology doesn't have theories like physics.

03:01:22.079 --> 03:01:27.032
You know physics is a much more successful sort of global Theory kind of kind of area.

03:01:27.156 --> 03:01:33.910
You know biology what are the global theories of biology pretty much darwinian Evolution that's the only Global theory of biology.

03:01:34.070 --> 03:01:39.609
You know other any other theory is just a well the kidneys work this way the this thing works this way and so on,

03:01:39.625 --> 03:01:49.493
there isn't a I suppose another Global theories digital information in DNA that's another sort of global fact about violence but the difficult thing to do is to match.

03:01:50.292 --> 03:01:55.940
Something you have a model of in the hypergraph to the actual like how do you discover the theory

03:01:55.784 --> 03:02:07.679
how do you how do you discover the theory okay you have something that looks nice and makes sense but like you have to match it to validation and oh sure right and that's tricky because you're walking around in the dark.

03:02:08.054 --> 03:02:22.810
Not entirely I mean so so you know for example in what we've been trying to think about is take actual chemical reactions okay so you know one of my one of my goals is can I compute the primes with molecules okay that's if I can do that.

03:02:22.871 --> 03:02:23.829
Then I kind of

03:02:23.826 --> 03:02:33.712
maybe I can compute things and you know there's this nice automated lab these guys is Emerald Cloud lab people have built with Wolfram language and so on that's an actual physical lab,

03:02:33.728 --> 03:02:39.898
and you send it a piece of Wolfram language code and it goes and you know actually does physical experiments and so one of my,

03:02:39.904 --> 03:02:51.709
one of my goals because I'm not a test tube kind of guy more of a software kind of person is can I make something where you know in this automated lab we can actually get it so that there's some gel that we made

03:02:51.688 --> 03:03:00.800
and you know the positions of the stripes of the primes I love it yeah I mean that would be that would be an example of where and that would be with a particular.

03:03:00.987 --> 03:03:09.227
You know framework for actually doing the molecular Computing you know with particular kinds of molecules and and there's a lot of kind of ambient.

03:03:09.341 --> 03:03:22.801
Technological mess so to speak associated with oh is it carbon is it this is it that you know is it important that there's a bromine atom here etc etc etc this is all chemistry that I don't know much about and you know that's that's a sort of

03:03:22.718 --> 03:03:27.700
you know unfortunately that's down at the level you know I would like to be at the software level

03:03:27.580 --> 03:03:40.816
not at the level of the transistors so to speak but in chemistry you know there's a certain amount we have to do I think at the level of transistors before we get up to being able to do it although you know automated Labs certainly help in setting that up.

03:03:41.488 --> 03:03:48.387
I talked to a guy named Charles hoskinson he mentioned that he's collaborating with you.

03:03:48.456 --> 03:04:04.510
He's an interesting guy he sends me papers on speaking of automated theorem proving a lot he's exceptionally well right on that area as well so what's the nature of your collaboration with him he's the creator of cardano what's the nature of the color collaboration between

03:04:04.309 --> 03:04:12.530
cardano and the hole spacer Block Chain and Wolfram Wolfram Alpha will from blockchain all that kind of stuff well okay we're segueing to it.

03:04:12.762 --> 03:04:22.370
A slightly different world but that time so although not completely unconnected right there the whole thing is somehow connected as I know I'm the the

03:04:22.331 --> 03:04:34.000
you know the strange thing in my life as I've sort of alternated between doing basic science and doing technology about five times in my life so far and the thing that's just crazy about it is you know every time

03:04:33.998 --> 03:04:35.910
I do one of these alternations I think.

03:04:36.033 --> 03:04:45.479
There's not going to be a way back to the other thing like I thought for this physics project I thought you know we're doing fundamental Theory of physics maybe it'll have an application in 200 years.

03:04:45.611 --> 03:04:47.783
But now I've realized.

03:04:47.961 --> 03:05:00.080
Actually this multi computation idea is applicable here and now it's an in fact it's also giving us this way I'll just mention one other thing and then with to talk about blockchain the.

03:05:00.807 --> 03:05:08.731
The question of actually that relates to several different things but but one of the things about about Okay so.

03:05:08.981 --> 03:05:15.213
Our Wolfram language which is our attempt to kind of represent everything in the world computationally.

03:05:15.346 --> 03:05:29.571
And that's the thing I kind of started building 40 years ago in the form of actual Wolfram language 35 years ago it's kind of this idea of can we can we express things about the world in computational terms.

03:05:29.731 --> 03:05:32.893
And you know we've come a long way and being able to do that

03:05:32.828 --> 03:05:47.568
Wolfram Alpha is kind of the consumer version of that way you're just using natural language as input the and it turns it into our symbolic language and that's you know the symbolic language Wolfram language is what people abused and have been using for the last 33 years actually

03:05:47.448 --> 03:05:57.155
Mathematica which is its first instantiation will be one third of a century old in in October and that.

03:05:57.350 --> 03:06:04.915
It's kind of interesting what do you mean 1/3 of a centuries I mean 33 or 30 what do we have 3 of 13 in the third.

03:06:05.119 --> 03:06:17.617
Um so but I've never heard of anyone celebrating that anniversary but I liked it I know a third of a century though it's like yeah I'll get many many slices of a century that interesting but but you know I think that the.

03:06:17.741 --> 03:06:24.810
The thing that's really striking about that is that means you know including the whole sort of Technology Stack Up built around that's about 40 years old.

03:06:24.942 --> 03:06:34.424
And that means it's a significant fraction of the total age of the computer industry and it's I mean I think it's cool that we can still run you know mathematical version 1 programs.

03:06:34.503 --> 03:06:40.113
Today and so on and we've sort of maintain compatibility and we've been just building this big tower.

03:06:40.192 --> 03:06:47.180
All those years of just more and more and more computational capabilities it's sort of interesting we just made this this picture

03:06:47.133 --> 03:06:55.598
of kind of the different kind of threads of computational content of you know mathematical content and and you know

03:06:55.460 --> 03:07:05.653
all sorts of things with you know data and graphs and whatever else and what you see in this picture is about the first ten years it's kind of like it's just a few threads and then

03:07:05.552 --> 03:07:16.186
then about maybe 15 20 years ago it kind of explodes in this whole collection different threads of all these different capabilities that are now part of Wolfram language and representing different things in the world.

03:07:16.408 --> 03:07:22.091
But the thing that was super Lucky in some sense is it's all based on one idea.

03:07:22.242 --> 03:07:35.640
It's all based on the idea of symbolic expressions and transformation rules for symbolic Expressions which was kind of what I originally put into this SMP system back in 1979 that was a predecessor of the whole Wolfram language stack.

03:07:35.898 --> 03:07:39.088
So that idea was an idea that I got,

03:07:39.148 --> 03:07:52.699
from sort of trying to understand mathematical logic and so on it was my attempt to kind of make a general human comprehensible model of computation of just everything is a symbolic expression and all you do is transform symbolic expressions.

03:07:52.967 --> 03:07:59.829
And you know in retrospect I was very lucky that I understood as little as I understood then.

03:07:59.934 --> 03:08:07.453
Because had I understood more I would have been completely freaked out about all the different ways that that kind of model can fail.

03:08:07.559 --> 03:08:19.633
Because what do you do when you have a symbolic expression you make Transformations for symbolic Expressions well for example one question is there may be many Transformations that could be made in a very multi computational kind of way.

03:08:19.829 --> 03:08:28.537
But what we're doing is picking will using the First Transformation that applies and we keep doing that until we reach a fixed point and that's the result.

03:08:28.724 --> 03:08:40.843
And that's kind of a very it's kind of a way of sort of sliding around the edge of multi computation and back when I was working on SMP and things I actually thought about these questions about about how,

03:08:40.895 --> 03:08:44.949
you know how what determines the kind of evaluation path.

03:08:45.045 --> 03:08:53.987
So for example you know you work out Fibonacci you know Fibonacci is recursive thing for then is f of n minus 1 plus FN minus 2 you get this whole tree of recursion.

03:08:54.668 --> 03:08:58.290
And there's the question of how do you evaluate that tree of recursion do you do it.

03:08:58.422 --> 03:09:11.000
Sort of depth first we go all the way down one side you do it breadth-first where your kind of collecting the terms together but you know that you know F of a plus F of 7 F of 7 plus 7 6 you can collect the F of sevens and so on

03:09:10.917 --> 03:09:20.715
these are you know I didn't realize it at the time it's kind of funny I was working on on gauge field there is back in 1979 and was also working on the evaluation model.

03:09:20.820 --> 03:09:26.206
And that's MP under the same problem but it took me 40 more years to realize that.

03:09:26.311 --> 03:09:40.933
And this question about how you do this sort of evaluation front that's a question of reference frames it's a question of kind of the story of I mean that that's that is basically this question of in what order is the universe evaluated

03:09:40.832 --> 03:09:54.086
and that's a and so what you realize is there's this whole sort of world of different kinds of computation that you can do sort of multi computationally and that's a that's an interesting thing it has a lot of implications for distributed computing and so on

03:09:54.002 --> 03:09:58.100
it also has a potential implication for blockchain which we haven't fully worked out.

03:09:58.242 --> 03:10:04.268
Which is some and this is not what we're doing with cardano but this is a different thing the.

03:10:04.805 --> 03:10:09.983
This is something where one of the questions is when you have.

03:10:10.134 --> 03:10:20.436
In a sense blockchain is a deeply sequentialized story of time because in blockchain there's just one copy of the of The Ledger and you're saying this is what happened.

03:10:20.505 --> 03:10:29.653
You know time has progressed in this way and that little things around the edge as as you try and reach consensus and so on and and you know actually we just recently

03:10:29.543 --> 03:10:40.358
we've had this little conference we organized about the theory of distributed consensus because I realized that a bunch of interesting things that some of our science can tell one about that but that's a different let's not go down that

03:10:40.247 --> 03:10:51.141
that part yeah but distributed consensus that still has a sequential there's like they stole sequentiality so you do don't tell me you're thinking through like how to apply multi computation to,

03:10:51.157 --> 03:10:55.310
Dolce yes and so that becomes a story of.

03:10:55.443 --> 03:11:05.087
You know instead of transactions all having to settle in one Ledger it's like a story of all these different Ledger's and they all have to have some ultimate consistency.

03:11:05.147 --> 03:11:12.000
Which is what causal invariance would give one but it can take a while and the it can take awhile is kind of like quantum mechanics.

03:11:12.079 --> 03:11:23.541
So it's kind of what's happening is that these different Paths of history that correspond to you know and one path of History you got paid this amount in another part of History you got paid this amount in the end

03:11:23.503 --> 03:11:28.547
the universe will always become consistent now now the way it works is.

03:11:28.895 --> 03:11:38.818
Okay it's a little bit more complicated than that what happens is the way space is knitted together in our Theory of physics is through all these events and the the idea is,

03:11:38.842 --> 03:11:43.030
that the way that economic space is knitted together is,

03:11:43.065 --> 03:11:56.102
is that these autonomous events that essentially knit together economic space so they're all these threads of transactions that are happening and the question is can they be made consistent are there is there something forcing them to be sort of a consistent,

03:11:56.109 --> 03:12:04.042
fabric of economic reality and sort of what this has led me to is trying to realize how does economics fundamentally work.

03:12:04.247 --> 03:12:10.668
And you know what is economics and you know what are the atoms of Economics right so to speak,

03:12:10.674 --> 03:12:20.183
and so what I've kind of realized is that that sort of the perhaps I don't even know if this is right yet there's sort of events in economics the transactions.

03:12:20.334 --> 03:12:27.484
There are states of agents that are kind of the atoms of economics and then transactions are kind of Agents.

03:12:27.635 --> 03:12:36.180
Transact and something transaction somewhere and that's an event and then the question is how do you knit together sort of economic space from that.

03:12:36.349 --> 03:12:48.981
What is their economic space well all these transactions there's a whole complicated collection of possible transactions but one thing that's true about economics as we tend to have the notion of a definite value for things we could imagine,

03:12:48.997 --> 03:12:58.010
that you know you buy a cookie from somebody and they want to get a movie ticket.

03:12:58.233 --> 03:13:08.003
And there is some way that AI Bots could make some path from the cookie to the movie ticket by all these different trans intermediate transactions.

03:13:08.226 --> 03:13:16.898
But in fact we have an approximation to that which is we say they each have a dollar value and we have this kind of numeraire concept.

03:13:17.039 --> 03:13:24.127
Of this just a way of kind of taking this whole complicated space of transactions and parsing it.

03:13:24.259 --> 03:13:30.382
And something which is a kind of a simplified thing that is kind of like our parsing of physical space.

03:13:30.579 --> 03:13:44.192
And so my guess is that the yet again I mean it's crazy that all these things are so connected this is another multi computation Story another story of where what's happening is that the economic consciousness

03:13:44.118 --> 03:13:49.620
the economic Observer is not going to deal with all of those are different microscopic transactions,

03:13:49.645 --> 03:13:56.796
they're just going to parse the whole thing by saying that is this value it's a number and that's that's their understanding of their summary,

03:13:56.802 --> 03:14:05.050
of this economic Network and there will be all kinds of things like they're all kinds of Arbitrage opportunities which are kind of like the quantum effects and this whole thing.

03:14:05.138 --> 03:14:13.260
And that's you know and places where there's with a sort of different paths that can be followed and and so on and there's so.

03:14:13.934 --> 03:14:22.533
The question is come one make a sort of global theory of economics and then my test case is again what is time dilation and economics

03:14:22.396 --> 03:14:33.840
and I know for you know if you imagine a very agricultural economics where people are growing lettuces and Fields and things like this and you ask questions about well if you're transporting lettuces to different places,

03:14:33.892 --> 03:14:37.900
you know what is the value of the lettuces after you have to transport them

03:14:37.817 --> 03:14:48.801
versus if you're just sitting in one place and selling them you can kind of get a little bit of an analogy there but I think there's a there's a better and more complete analogy and that there's the question of is there a theory like General activity

03:14:48.736 --> 03:14:58.533
that is a global theory of economics and is it about something we care about it could be that there is a global Theory but it's about a feature of economic reality that isn't important to us.

03:14:58.612 --> 03:15:07.536
Another part of the story is come one use those ideas to make essentially a distributed blockchain a distributed generalization of blockchain.

03:15:07.659 --> 03:15:19.004
Kind of the quantum analog of money so to speak where where you have for example you can have uncertainty relations where you're saying you know well if I insist on knowing my bank account right now.

03:15:19.101 --> 03:15:24.316
They'll be some uncertainty if I'm prepared to wait a while then it'll be much more certain.

03:15:24.457 --> 03:15:34.173
And so that's you know is there a way of using and so we've made a bunch of prototypes of this which I'm not yet happy with this but I realized is

03:15:34.045 --> 03:15:37.757
to really understand these prototypes actually have to have a foundational theory of.

03:15:37.835 --> 03:15:46.560
And so that's kind of a you know it may be that we could deploy up one of these prototypes as a practical system but I think it's really going to be much better if we actually have,

03:15:46.594 --> 03:15:54.276
an understanding of how this plugs into kind of Economics that means like a fundamental theory of transactions between entities.

03:15:54.372 --> 03:15:56.741
Well if that's what you mean by economics,

03:15:56.757 --> 03:16:07.149
yes I think so but I mean you know how their emerge sort of laws of Economics I don't even know and I've been asking friends of mine who are who are economists and things what is the economics

03:16:07.146 --> 03:16:18.195
is it an axiomatic theory is it a theory that is a kind of a qualitative description theory is that you know what kind of a theory is it is it a theory you know what kind of thinking it's like.

03:16:18.300 --> 03:16:30.717
Like an in biology and evolutionary biology for example there's a certain there's a certain pattern of thinking that goes on and evolutionary biology where if you're a you know a good Eeveelution in biologist somebody says that creature has a weird horn,

03:16:30.768 --> 03:16:37.370
and they'll say well that's because this and this and this and this selection of this kind in that kind and that's the story.

03:16:37.502 --> 03:16:45.868
And it's not a mathematical story it's a story of a different type of thinking about these things by the way evolution in biology is yet another place

03:16:45.802 --> 03:16:55.329
well it looks like this multi computational idea can be applied and that's where we're maybe speciation is related to things like event Horizons and as a whole

03:16:55.263 --> 03:17:01.153
whole other kind of world of that but because things like this kind of model can be applicable so many.

03:17:01.232 --> 03:17:11.244
Specs like I did the different levels of understanding of our reality so it can fix biology at the chemistry at the physics level

03:17:11.098 --> 03:17:15.601
right they economics and you could potentially it's the thing is.

03:17:15.833 --> 03:17:27.781
It's like okay sure it all these levels in my rhyme it might make sense as a model the question is can you make useful predictions as one of these loving that's that's right and that's that's really a question of,

03:17:27.815 --> 03:17:31.680
you know it's a weird situation because the situation where the model.

03:17:31.965 --> 03:17:40.141
Probably has definite consequences the question is are there consequences we care about yeah and that's some you know and so,

03:17:40.202 --> 03:17:46.858
so in the case of and the economic case the where.

03:17:47.035 --> 03:17:58.318
Um so you know the one one thing is this this idea of using kind of physics like Notions to construct a kind of distributed analog blockchain okay the much more pragmatic thing,

03:17:58.369 --> 03:18:04.079
is a different direction and it has to do with this computational language that we built to describe the world.

03:18:04.158 --> 03:18:11.640
That knows about you know different kinds of cookies and knows about different cities and knows about how to compute all these kinds of things.

03:18:11.782 --> 03:18:17.475
One of the things that is of interest is if you want to run the world you need you know with.

03:18:17.814 --> 03:18:24.730
With contracts and laws and rules and so on there are rules at a human level and there are kind of things like.

03:18:24.800 --> 03:18:39.539
And so this this gets one into the idea of computational contracts right now when we write a contract it's a piece of legalese it's you know it's just written in English and it's not something that's automatically analyzable executable whatever else it's just.

03:18:39.635 --> 03:18:41.663
English you know back in.

03:18:41.760 --> 03:18:50.306
Gottfried leibniz back in you know 1680 or whatever was like going to you know figure out how to use logic.

03:18:50.465 --> 03:18:57.723
To decide legal cases and so on and he had kind of this idea of Let's Make a computational language for the human human law.

03:18:57.964 --> 03:19:05.736
Forget about modeling nature forgot about natural laws what about human law can we make kind of a computational representation of that

03:19:05.625 --> 03:19:12.650
well I think finally we're close to being able to do that and one of the projects that I hope to get to as soon as the

03:19:12.521 --> 03:19:23.227
there's a little bit of slowing down of some of this Cambrian explosion that's happening as a project I've been meaning to really do for a long time which is what I'm calling a symbolic discourse language it is just

03:19:23.170 --> 03:19:32.968
finishing the job of being able to represent everything like the conversation we're having in computational terms and one of the use cases for that is computational.

03:19:33.235 --> 03:19:44.077
Another use case is something like the Constitution that says what the a is what we want the ai's to do so but this is useful so you saying so these are like using computation contract

03:19:44.074 --> 03:19:52.160
the smart contracts this is what's in the domain of cryptocurrency is known as smart contracts and so the language you've developed this symbolic.

03:19:52.473 --> 03:19:58.110
Or seek to further develop symbolic discourse language enables you to.

03:19:58.423 --> 03:20:06.015
Write a contract in Rosso right contract that really represents the will stop some aspect of the world yeah but so so

03:20:05.994 --> 03:20:10.992
I mean smart contracts tend to be right now mostly about things happening on the blockchain

03:20:10.837 --> 03:20:21.769
yes sometimes they have oracle's and in fact our Wolfram Alpha API is the main thing people use to get information about the real world so to speak yeah within smart contracts the Wolfram Alpha

03:20:21.703 --> 03:20:33.526
as it stands is a really good Oracle yes whoever wants to use it that's perhaps where the relationship with cardano so that's how we started getting involved with blockchains as we realize people are using you know Wolfram Alpha as

03:20:33.451 --> 03:20:41.115
the Oracle for smart contract so to speak and so that got us interested in blockchains in general and what was ended up happening is

03:20:41.085 --> 03:20:46.048
Wolfram language is with its symbolic representation of things is really very good at representing.

03:20:46.252 --> 03:20:55.510
Things like blockchains and so I think we now have them I don't really know all the comparisons but we now have a really nice environment within Wolfram language for dealing with,

03:20:55.561 --> 03:20:56.869
the set of

03:20:56.758 --> 03:21:06.482
you know for representing what happens in blockchains for analyzing what happens in blockchains we have a whole effort in blockchain analytics and you know we've

03:21:06.408 --> 03:21:19.824
sort of published some samples of how that works but but it's you know because our technology stack Wolfram language and Mathematica a very widely used in the Quant Finance world there's a there's a sort of immediate sort of

03:21:19.822 --> 03:21:25.630
coevolution their of sort of the Quant Finance kind of thing and blockchain Analytics,

03:21:25.691 --> 03:21:30.392
and that's some so so it's kind of the representation of blockchain in computational language.

03:21:30.498 --> 03:21:36.227
Then ultimately it's kind of like how do you run the world with code that is how do you write,

03:21:36.287 --> 03:21:42.221
sort of all these things which are right now regulations and laws and contracts and things and computational language,

03:21:42.228 --> 03:21:55.816
I'm kind of the ultimate vision is that sort of something happens in the world and then there's this giant domino effect of all these computational contracts that trigger based on the thing that happened and there's a there's a whole story to that and of course.

03:21:55.903 --> 03:22:02.783
You know I like to always pay attention to the latest things that are going on and I really kind of like Watch chain because it's a

03:22:02.709 --> 03:22:14.152
it's a it's another rethinking of kind of computation that's kind of like you know cloud computing was a little bit of that of sort of persistent kind of computational resources and so on

03:22:14.051 --> 03:22:19.240
and this multi computation is a big rethinking of kind of what it means to compute.

03:22:19.390 --> 03:22:28.197
Blockchain is another bit of rethinking of what it means to compute the idea that you Lodge kind of these autonomous lumps of computation out there in the blockchain world.

03:22:28.437 --> 03:22:31.150
And one of the things that just sort of,

03:22:31.174 --> 03:22:39.503
for fun so to speak as we've been doing a bit of stuff with n ftes and we just did some entities Uncle Donna and we'll be doing some more and

03:22:39.393 --> 03:22:51.593
you know we did some cellular automaton and lefties on Katana words like like quite a bit and you know one of the things I've realized about about NF tease is that there's kind of this notion and we really

03:22:51.492 --> 03:23:00.749
working on this you know I like recording stuff you know one of the things that's come out of kind of my science I suppose has this this history matters type.

03:23:00.845 --> 03:23:04.970
Type story of you know it's not just the current state it's the history that matters

03:23:04.959 --> 03:23:17.790
and I've kind of I don't think this is such and realizing maybe it's not coincidental that I'm sort of the human whose recorded more about themselves than anybody else and then I end up with these science results that say history matters which was not,

03:23:17.806 --> 03:23:26.748
those things I didn't think those were connected but Charlie's Coral 80s yeah right so you know this question about sort of recording what has happened.

03:23:26.889 --> 03:23:38.487
And and having sort of a permanent record of things one of the things that's kind of interesting there is you know you put up a website and it's got a bunch of stuff on it but you know you have to keep paying the hosting fees or the things going to go away.

03:23:38.844 --> 03:23:53.132
One of the things about blockchains quite interesting is if you put something on a blockchain and you pay you know your commission to get that thing you know put on you know mind put on the Block blockchain then then in a sense everybody who comes after you.

03:23:53.328 --> 03:24:04.043
Is you know they are motivated to keep your thing alive because that's what keeps the consistency of the blockchain so in a sense with sort of the nft world it's kind of like if you want to have something permanent.

03:24:04.167 --> 03:24:10.201
Well at least for the life of the blockchain but even if the blockchain goes out of circulation so to speak.

03:24:10.271 --> 03:24:17.700
That's going to be enough value in that whole collection of transactions the people are going to Archive the thing but that means that you know pay once.

03:24:17.833 --> 03:24:20.913
And you're kind of you're lodged in the blockchain forever.

03:24:21.001 --> 03:24:29.664
And so we've been kind of playing around with a sort of a hobby thing of mine of thinking about sort of the nft he's and how you

03:24:29.554 --> 03:24:36.631
I'm sort of the consumer idea of kind of the it's the it's the anti you know the opposite of the Snapchat

03:24:36.539 --> 03:24:45.806
view of the world there's a permanence to it this heavily incentivized and thereby you can have a permanence of History.

03:24:46.235 --> 03:24:48.262
And that's that's that's kind of the.

03:24:48.377 --> 03:24:58.886
Now you know so that's so that's one of the things we've been doing with Cod I know and it's kind of fun I think that that I mean this whole question about you know you mentioned automated theorem proving and blockchains and so on.

03:24:59.027 --> 03:25:02.630
And as I thought about this kind of physics inspired distributed blockchain.

03:25:02.736 --> 03:25:12.335
Obviously they're the sort of the proof that it works that there no double spends there's no whatever else that proof becomes a very formal,

03:25:12.395 --> 03:25:20.167
kind of almost a matter of physics so to speak and you know it's been it's been an interesting thing for the the practical blockchains,

03:25:20.227 --> 03:25:33.751
to do kind of actual automated theorem proving and I don't think anybody's really Managed IT an interesting case yet it's a thing that people you know aspire to but I think it's a challenging thing because basically the point is one of the one of the things about,

03:25:33.794 --> 03:25:39.233
proving correctness of something as well you know people say I've got this program and I'm going to prove its correct.

03:25:39.447 --> 03:25:53.035
It's like what does that mean you have to say what correct means I mean it's it's kind of like then you have to have another language and people are very confused back in past Decades of you know oh we're going to prove the correctness by representing the program in another language.

03:25:53.158 --> 03:26:03.495
Which we also don't know whether it's correct and you know Often by correctness we just mean it can't crash or it can't scribble on memory but but the thing is that there's this complicated trade-off.

03:26:03.627 --> 03:26:14.667
Because as soon as there's as soon as you're really using computation you have computational error disability you have undecidability if you want to use computation seriously you have to kind of.

03:26:14.763 --> 03:26:28.557
Let go of the idea that you're going to be able to box it in and say we're going to have just this happen and not anything else I mean this is a this is an old fact I mean godel's theorem tries to say you know p on arithmetic the axioms of arithmetic.

03:26:28.672 --> 03:26:42.312
Can you box in the integers and say these axioms give just the integers and nothing about the integers go to the therm show that wasn't the case there's a you know you can have all these wild weird things that are Bay the piano axioms but aren't integers

03:26:42.310 --> 03:26:46.598
and there's this kind of infinite hierarchy of additional axioms you would have to add

03:26:46.532 --> 03:26:55.429
and it's kind of the same thing you don't get to you know if you want to say I want to know what happens you're boxing yourself in and there's a limit to what can happen so to speak.

03:26:55.498 --> 03:27:08.824
So it's a complicated trade-off and it's a it's a big trade-off for a I so to speak it's kind of like do you want to let computation actually do what it can do or do you want to say no it's very very boxed in to the point where we can understand every step.

03:27:09.029 --> 03:27:15.639
And that's a that's kind of a thing that that becomes difficult to do but that's some I mean in general.

03:27:16.465 --> 03:27:23.516
I would say one of the things that's kind of complicated in my sort of life in the whole sort of story of computational language and

03:27:23.513 --> 03:27:37.596
all this technology and science and so on I mean I kind of in the flow of one's life it's sort of interesting to see how these things play out because I you know I've kind of concluded that I'm in the business of making kind of artifacts from the future.

03:27:37.890 --> 03:27:44.978
Which means you know that things that I've done I don't know this physics project I don't know whether anybody would have gotten to it for 50 years.

03:27:45.146 --> 03:27:52.135
You know the fact that mathematical is a third of a century old and I know that the bunch of the core ideas are not well absorbed.

03:27:52.312 --> 03:28:02.550
I mean that is people finally got this idea that I thought was a triviality of notebooks that was 25 years and you know some of these core ideas about symbolic computation and so on,

03:28:02.601 --> 03:28:08.087
not not absorbed I mean people people use them everyday and Wolfram language,

03:28:08.138 --> 03:28:15.413
and you know do all kinds of cool things with them but if you say what is the fundamental intellectual Point here it's not well absorbed

03:28:15.411 --> 03:28:22.238
and it's something where you kind of realized that you're sort of building things and I kind of made this thing about you know

03:28:22.208 --> 03:28:34.229
will building artifacts from the future so to speak and I mentioned that we have a conference every coming up actually in a couple of weeks our annual technology conference where we talk about all the all the things we're doing

03:28:34.118 --> 03:28:40.440
and you know so I was talking about it last year about you know we're making artifacts from the future and I was kind of like.

03:28:40.627 --> 03:28:46.012
I had some some version of that that was kind of a dark and frustrated thing of like you know

03:28:45.974 --> 03:28:53.592
I'm building things which nobody's going to care about until long after I'm dead so to speak but but but then I realized you know people

03:28:53.491 --> 03:29:05.862
what was sort of telling me afterwards you know that's exactly how you know we're using Wolfram language in some particular setting and you know some computational X field or some organization or whatever and it's like people are saying

03:29:05.860 --> 03:29:08.168
oh you know what did you manage to do

03:29:08.147 --> 03:29:18.141
you know what we know that in principle it will be possible to do that but we didn't know that was possible now and it's kind of like that's the that's sort of the business were in a sense with some of these ideas in science.

03:29:18.238 --> 03:29:25.451
You know I feel a little bit the same way that there are some of these things where you know some some things like for example this hole

03:29:25.431 --> 03:29:39.226
idea well so so to relate to another piece of history on the future one of you know I mentioned mentioned at the beginning kind of complexity as this thing that I was interested in Back 40 years ago and so on where does complexity come from.

03:29:39.403 --> 03:29:41.638
Well I think we kind of nailed that.

03:29:41.734 --> 03:29:51.235
The answer is in the computational universe even simple programs make it and that's kind of the secret the Nature has that allows you to make it so so that's kind of the

03:29:51.232 --> 03:29:54.420
that's that part but the bigger picture there

03:29:54.364 --> 03:30:04.323
was this idea of this kind of computational Paradigm the idea that you could go beyond mathematical equations which have been sort of the primary modeling medium for 300 years

03:30:04.213 --> 03:30:05.772
and so it was like

03:30:05.671 --> 03:30:20.510
look it is inexorably the case that people will use programs rather than just equations and you know I was saying that in the 1980s and people were you know I published my big book new kind of science that will be 20 years ago next year so in 2002

03:30:20.426 --> 03:30:26.568
and people are saying oh no this can't possibly be true you know we know for 300 years we've been doing all this stuff right.

03:30:26.728 --> 03:30:32.140
To be fair I now realize a little bit more analysis of what people actually said.

03:30:32.282 --> 03:30:39.559
And pretty much every field other than physics people said oh these are new models that's pretty interesting and physics,

03:30:39.610 --> 03:30:52.036
people will like we've got our physics models we're very happy with them yeah physics there's more resistance because of the attachment and the power of the equations right idea that programs might be the right way to approach right

03:30:51.934 --> 03:30:55.861
this field was there's some resistance and like you're saying.

03:30:55.976 --> 03:31:09.896
It takes time for somebody who likes the idea of time dilation and all these applications I thought you would understand this yeah right but but you know and computational irreducibility yes exactly but but I mean it is really interesting that just 20 years.

03:31:10.236 --> 03:31:19.187
The span of 20 years it's gone from you know pitchforks and horror to yeah we get it and you know it's helped.

03:31:19.373 --> 03:31:21.950
That we've you know in our current.

03:31:22.155 --> 03:31:29.430
Effort in fundamental physics we've gotten a lot further and we've managed to put a lot of puzzle pieces together that makes sense,

03:31:29.455 --> 03:31:38.848
but the thing that I've been thinking about recently is this field of complexity so I kind of was a sort of a field Builder back in the 1980s I was kind of like,

03:31:38.908 --> 03:31:50.758
okay you know can we you know I'd understood this point that there was this sort of fundamental phenomenon of complexity and showed up in lots of places and I was like this is an interesting sort of field of science.

03:31:50.863 --> 03:31:52.962
And I was recently.

03:31:53.626 --> 03:32:07.204
I was reminded I was at this the very first sort of get together of what became the Santa Fe Institute I was like in fact there's even an audio recording of me sort of saying people have been talking about or what should this you know outfit do and I was saying.

03:32:07.319 --> 03:32:22.193
Well there is this thing that I've been thinking about it's this kind of idea of complexity a nice and it's kind of like and that's that's what that ended up in a plant is the seat of complexity Santa Fe as beautiful it's a beautiful Vision but but I mean so that but what's happened then.

03:32:22.299 --> 03:32:37.253
Is this idea of complexity and you know can you know and I started the first Research Center at University of Illinois for doing that in the first Journal complex systems and so on and it's kind of an interesting thing in my life at least that it's kind of like

03:32:37.197 --> 03:32:39.559
you plant the seed you have this idea.

03:32:39.628 --> 03:32:48.200
It's a kind of a science idea you have this idea of sort of focusing on the phenomenon of complexity the deeper idea was this computational Paradigm but

03:32:48.162 --> 03:32:58.130
the nominal idea is this kind of idea of complexity okay then you roll time forward 30 years or whatever 35 years whatever it is and you say what happened.

03:32:58.317 --> 03:33:10.022
Okay well now there are thousand complexity institutes around the world I think more or less we've been trying to count them and you know there are 40 complexity journals I think and so.

03:33:10.524 --> 03:33:16.657
It's kind of like what actually happened in this field right and I look at a lot of what happened and I'm like.

03:33:16.933 --> 03:33:26.730
You know I have to admit some eye-rolling so to speak because it's kind of like like what is what what's what's actually going on well what people definitely got.

03:33:26.953 --> 03:33:29.296
Was this idea of computational models.

03:33:29.483 --> 03:33:38.227
And then they got but they thought one of the one of the kind of cognitive mistakes I think is they say we've got a computational model and it.

03:33:38.548 --> 03:33:45.923
We're looking at a system that's complex and our computational model gives complexity by golly that must mean it's right.

03:33:46.434 --> 03:33:54.575
Unfortunately because complexity is a generic phenomenon and computational irreducibility is a generic phenomenon that actually tells you nothing.

03:33:54.833 --> 03:34:05.404
And so then the question is well what can you do you know there's a lot of things that have been sort of done under this Banner of complexity and I think it's been very successful in providing sort of an interdisciplinary

03:34:05.384 --> 03:34:19.942
way of connecting different fields together in this powerful in itself right I mean it's a validation economists and yeah it is right and it's an organizing principle but but in the end a lot of that is around the Sun of computational Paradigm computational modeling that's the raw material

03:34:19.904 --> 03:34:23.120
the powers that kind of that kind of Correspondence I.

03:34:23.343 --> 03:34:30.737
Then the question is sort of what is the you know I was just thinking recently you know we've been I mean the other we've been we've been.

03:34:30.923 --> 03:34:37.443
For years people have told me you should start some Wolfram Institute that does basic science you know all I have is a company that.

03:34:37.612 --> 03:34:45.383
Build software and we you know we have a little piece that does basic science is kind of a hobby people are saying you should start this Wolfram Institute thing.

03:34:45.489 --> 03:34:50.110
And I've been you know because I've known about lots of institutes and I've seen kind of that flow of money and,

03:34:50.161 --> 03:34:55.538
and kind of you know what happens in different situations and so on so I've been kind of reluctant but but I

03:34:55.490 --> 03:35:06.700
I have realized that you know what we've done with our company over the last 35 years we built a very good machine for doing R&D and you know innovating and creating things and I just

03:35:06.572 --> 03:35:15.397
applied that machine to the physics project that's how we did the physics project in a fairly short amount of time with a you know efficient machine with

03:35:15.286 --> 03:35:27.432
you know various people involved and so on and so you know it works for basic science and it's like we can do more of this and so if knowledge in chemistry said it's become an Institute,

03:35:27.457 --> 03:35:35.517
yes well it needs to become an instant an official institution right but the thing that's I was thinking about okay so what do we do with complexity.

03:35:35.667 --> 03:35:41.980
You know what what they're all these people who've you know what should happen to that field and what I realized is

03:35:41.978 --> 03:35:45.770
that's kind of this area foundations of complexity that's about,

03:35:45.777 --> 03:35:57.276
these questions about simple programs what they do that's far away from a bunch of the detail applications that people it's not far away it's the it's the under you know the Bedrock underneath those applications,

03:35:57.327 --> 03:36:02.695
so I realized recently this is my recent kind of little innovation of a sort.

03:36:02.782 --> 03:36:12.310
Um a post that I'll do very soon the about kind of you know the foundations of complexity

03:36:12.298 --> 03:36:22.823
what really are they I think they're really two ideas to conceptual ideas that I hadn't really enunciated I think before one is what I call metamodeling the other is really ology

03:36:22.740 --> 03:36:31.231
so what is metamodeling so matter modeling is you've got this complicated model and it's a model of you know hedgehogs interacting with this interacting with that.

03:36:31.508 --> 03:36:34.608
And the question is what's really underneath that what is it.

03:36:34.740 --> 03:36:48.192
Is it a turing machine is that a cellular automaton you know what is the underlying stuff underneath that model and so there's this kind of meta Science question of given these models what is the core model.

03:36:48.316 --> 03:36:56.826
And I realized I mean to me that's an obvious question but then I realized I've been doing language design for 40 years and language design is exactly that question,

03:36:56.832 --> 03:37:07.439
you know underneath all of this detailed stuff people do what are the underlying premises and that's a question people haven't tended to ask about models they say well we've got this nice model for this and that and the other

03:37:07.409 --> 03:37:09.816
what's really underneath it and what

03:37:09.804 --> 03:37:20.123
you know because once you have the thing that's underneath it well for example this multi computation idea is an ultimate metamodeling idea because it's saying underneath all these fields,

03:37:20.130 --> 03:37:26.578
is one kind of paradigmatic structure and you know you can you can imagine the same kind of thing that much more sort of.

03:37:26.638 --> 03:37:36.471
Much sort of shallower levels and in different kinds of modeling so there's the first activity is this kind of metamodeling the kind of the

03:37:36.325 --> 03:37:43.781
the models about models so to speak you know what is the what's what's you know drilling down into models that's one thing

03:37:43.698 --> 03:37:58.518
the other thing is this this thing that I think we're going to call really ology which is kind of the okay you've got these simple rules you've got cellular automata you've got turning machines you've got substitution systems you've got register machines got all these different things what do they actually do in the wild.

03:37:58.794 --> 03:38:10.472
And this is an area that I've spent a lot of time you know working on it's a lot of stuff in my new kind of science book is about this you know this new book I wrote about combinator's is is full of stuff like this

03:38:10.425 --> 03:38:15.442
and and this journal complex systems is has lots of papers about these kinds of things but.

03:38:15.737 --> 03:38:25.200
There isn't really a home for people who do really ology or what I'm not as you called the basic science of rules yes yes right so it's like

03:38:25.063 --> 03:38:39.982
you've got some what is it is it mathematics know it isn't really like mathematics in fact from my now understanding of matter mathematics I understand that it's the molecular Dynamics level it's not the level that mathematicians have traditionally cared about it's not computer science

03:38:39.899 --> 03:38:46.626
because computer science is about writing programs that do things you know that work for a purpose not programs in the wild so to speak.

03:38:46.768 --> 03:38:55.287
It's not physics it doesn't have anything to do with you know maybe underneath some Physics but it's not physics as such so it just hasn't had a home and if you look at.

03:38:55.419 --> 03:39:04.478
You know but what's great about it is it's a surviving field so to speak it's something where you know one of the things I find sort of inspiring

03:39:04.475 --> 03:39:16.360
about mathematics for example is you look at mathematics that was done you know in ancient Greece ancient you know Babylon Egypt and so on it's still here today you know you find an icosahedron that somebody made,

03:39:16.376 --> 03:39:24.436
in ancient Egypt you look at it oh that's a very modern thing it's an icosahedron you know it's a Timeless kind of kind of activity.

03:39:24.541 --> 03:39:31.583
And this idea of studying simple rules and what they do it's a Timeless activity and I can see that over the last 40 years or so.

03:39:31.671 --> 03:39:39.433
As you know even when cellular automata it's kind of like you know you can sort of catalog what are the different salad or am used.

03:39:39.935 --> 03:39:48.400
And you know like the the simplest rules like one you might even know this one rule 184 it's rule 184 is a minimum model for road traffic.

03:39:48.811 --> 03:39:58.095
And you know it's also a minimum model for various other things but it's kind of fun that you can literally say you know rule 90 as a minimum model for this and this and this.

03:39:58.200 --> 03:40:06.089
Rule for as a mental model for this and it's kind of remarkable that you can just buy in this Roar level of this kind of study of rules.

03:40:06.213 --> 03:40:09.060
They then branch that are the raw material

03:40:09.039 --> 03:40:18.828
that you can use to make models of different things so it's a it's a very pure basic science but it's one that you know people have explored it but they've been kind of a little bit in the wilderness,

03:40:18.843 --> 03:40:32.430
and I think you know one of the things that I would like to do finally is you know I always thought that sort of this notion of pure and KS pure band and gasping the acronym for my book new kind of science was.

03:40:33.021 --> 03:40:42.990
It was something that people should be doing and you know we tried to figure out what's the right institutional structure to do this stuff you know we dealt with a bunch of universities oh you know can we do this here

03:40:42.852 --> 03:40:55.818
well what department would be in it well it isn't in a department it's so new kind of thing that's why that's why the book was called a new kind of science its kind of the the because that's an increasingly good description of what it is so to speak.

03:40:56.121 --> 03:41:10.510
We're actually work we were thinking about kind of the rule illogical Society because we're realizing that it's kind of lower it's some you know there's a there's it's very it's very interesting I mean I've never really done something like this before because there's this whole group of researchers.

03:41:10.597 --> 03:41:13.237
Who who've been doing things that are really.

03:41:13.576 --> 03:41:20.727
In some cases very elegant very surviving very solid you know here's this thing that happens in this very abstract system.

03:41:20.985 --> 03:41:26.750
But it's like it's like what is that part of you know it doesn't have a home.

03:41:26.837 --> 03:41:34.860
And I think that's something I you know I kind of felt myself for not having been more you know when complexity was developing in the 80s I didn't understand.

03:41:34.957 --> 03:41:44.384
The the the danger of applications that is it's really cool that you can apply the stick anomic so you can apply it to evolutionary biology and this and that and the other.

03:41:45.003 --> 03:41:55.871
What happens with applications is everything that sucked into the applications and the pure stuff it's like the pure mathematics there isn't any pure mathematics so to speak it's all just applications of mathematics.

03:41:56.175 --> 03:42:00.561
And I failed to kind of make sure that this kind of pure area.

03:42:00.667 --> 03:42:11.050
Was was kind of maintained and developed and I think now you know one of the things I want to try to do and you know it's a funny thing because I'm used to look I've been a.

03:42:11.461 --> 03:42:14.039
Text CEO for more than half my life now so,

03:42:14.063 --> 03:42:22.807
you know this is what I know how to do and you know I can I can make stuff happen and get projects to happen even as it turns out basic science.

03:42:23.065 --> 03:42:35.428
In that kind of setting and how that translates into kind of you know there a lot of people working on for example a physics project sort of distributed through the academic world and that's working just great but the question is you know can we have,

03:42:35.488 --> 03:42:45.420
a sort of accelerator mechanism that makes use of kind of what we've learnt in sort of R&D Innovation and you know but on the other hand it's a funny thing because

03:42:45.337 --> 03:42:48.102
you know in a company in the end

03:42:48.055 --> 03:42:59.770
the thing is you know it's a company that makes products that sell things sells things to people in you know when you're doing basic research one of the challenges is there isn't that same kind of sort of mechanism

03:42:59.740 --> 03:43:08.970
and so it's you know how do you drive the thing in a kind of an alleged kind of way so that it really can make forward progress rather than.

03:43:09.076 --> 03:43:15.668
You know what can often happen in oh and academic settings where it's like well they're all these flowers blooming but it's not clear.

03:43:15.746 --> 03:43:30.387
That the that it's the active essential Mission and the drive just like you do with the company that's delivering a big overarching product and rights that's but the challenges you know when you have a the the economics of the world.

03:43:30.456 --> 03:43:31.638
A such that

03:43:31.626 --> 03:43:46.546
you know when you're delivering a product to people say wow that's useful will buy it and then that kind of feeds back and okay then you can then you can pay the people who build it to eat you know so they can eat and so on and with basic science the the payoff.

03:43:46.714 --> 03:43:53.342
Is very much less visible and you know with the physics project is to say the big surprise has been that I mean you know.

03:43:53.493 --> 03:43:56.943
For example well the big surprise was a physics project is.

03:43:57.022 --> 03:44:09.591
That it's looks like it has near-term applications and I was like I'm guessing this 200 years away it's um I was kind of using the analogy of you know Newton starting a satellite launch company.

03:44:09.805 --> 03:44:11.770
Which would have been kind of wrong time.

03:44:11.893 --> 03:44:22.717
Um and you know but it turns out that's not the case but but we can't guarantee that and if you say we're signing up to do basic research basic really ology let's say and,

03:44:22.732 --> 03:44:23.419
you know

03:44:23.353 --> 03:44:35.670
and we can't we don't know the Horizon you know it's an unknown Horizon it's kind of like an undecidable kind of proposition of when is this proof going to end so to speak when is it going to be something that they get supplied.

03:44:36.110 --> 03:44:45.529
Wow I hope this is this becomes a vibrant New Field of really ology I love it like I told you many many times it's one of

03:44:45.499 --> 03:44:53.981
the most amazing ideas that has been brought to this world so I hope you get a bunch of people to explore this world.

03:44:54.681 --> 03:45:00.536
Thank you once again for spending your really valuable time with me today fun stuff thank you.

03:45:01.271 --> 03:45:07.844
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Stephen Wolfram to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description.

03:45:08.095 --> 03:45:16.920
And now let me leave you with some words from Richard feinman nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns.

03:45:17.124 --> 03:45:26.750
Each small piece of our fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry
thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
