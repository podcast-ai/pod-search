The show,

00:00:47.832 --> 00:01:02.607
It's About You by Brave a fast privacy-preserving browser that feels like Google Chrome but without ads or the various kinds of tracking that adds can do I love using it more than any other browsers including Chrome I still use.

00:01:02.847 --> 00:01:12.087
Firefox age Chrome all those but I use them like one percent of my time my main driver in terms of web browsing is Brave.

00:01:12.282 --> 00:01:25.095
It's fast it's just snappier I guess is the right term to use snappier than any other browser I use it's also exciting to me like I feel like I'm supporting innovation in the space.

00:01:25.425 --> 00:01:32.837
It's exciting to see that given all the web browser Wars of the past they're still new innovators the that come up,

00:01:32.987 --> 00:01:40.957
and dominate and come up with good ideas that really push everybody else to do better so I'm a huge supporter and fan

00:01:40.918 --> 00:01:53.542
of Brave browser they by the way have their own search engine called Brave search engine you should use that to I use it I love it get it at Brave.com Lex and it might become your favorite browser to.

00:01:54.907 --> 00:02:09.719
The show is also brought to you by skiff a private end-to-end encrypted email also they do collaboration but emails the thing the latest thing that they want to focus on I love it both for document collaboration and for email.

00:02:10.382 --> 00:02:16.057
What does end-to-end encryption mean it means that nobody nobody,

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:27.400
no big tech company not skiff themselves have access to your email that means you can email whoever the heck you want and the world can't know about it it's just between you and the person you're emailing.

00:02:28.117 --> 00:02:34.493
As our world becomes more and more digital
this is the Battleground for privacy.

00:02:34.697 --> 00:02:42.487
Skiff puts emphasis on the privacy in the security and on top of that makes the thing look sexy.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:55.037
Easy to use like the interface of an email client obviously is essential it can make a break a client and Skip does it extremely well you can get 10 gigabytes of free storage.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:04.111
And it works on mobile and desktop all that kind of stuff it's easy to migrate from other email Services you can sign up ask if.com Lex.

00:03:05.512 --> 00:03:07.991
This show is brought to you by missing a main.

00:03:08.258 --> 00:03:21.728
The maker of comfortable stylish dress shirts and other menswear I'm wearing one of their shirts right now in this very hot Austin summer because it feels cool refreshing it feels great against the body just Matt it's.

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.257
I'm trying to use words to describe what I'm wearing.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.179
Which is hard to do anyway just feels good and I like how it fits the body I think,

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:48.213
however the science of cloth and all that kind of stuff works it just it feels good it looks good I love it now they have all kinds of styles colorful and so on but as you can imagine I go for the black dress shirt that's what I that's what I love,

00:03:48.318 --> 00:03:52.624
that's why I feel good in its lightweight breathable and moisture-wicking.

This shows also brought to you by athletic greens and the AG one drink which is an all-in-one daily drink to support Better Health and Peak Performance to replace the multivitamin for me.

00:04:20.645 --> 00:04:28.732
And went far beyond that was 75 vitamins and minerals it's the first thing I drink every day I drink it twice a day.

00:04:28.927 --> 00:04:38.149
It gives me a nutritional basis for all the crazy diet physical and mental Endeavors I undertake.

00:04:38.992 --> 00:04:44.477
Sometimes I fast for 24 hours sometimes even longer

00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:56.621
sometimes because I want to sometimes because I just lose my mind in a particular task I'm doing and I forget to eat which is a beautiful beautiful thing but if you do that beautiful thing you should make sure your body doesn't

00:04:56.618 --> 00:05:05.218
right out of sort of the essential vitamins and minerals it needs that's what I count on athletic greens to do plus is delicious.

00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:12.753

This Deluxe treatment podcast support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here Susan Cain.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:41.200
Music.

00:06:41.045 --> 00:06:50.941
You've written on your website that quote I prefer listening to talking reading to socializing and cozy chats to group settings.

00:06:51.397 --> 00:07:00.690
So I think this conversation in the podcast is going to be fun what's a good definition of an introvert is something like those three things a good start.

00:07:01.327 --> 00:07:10.008
It is a good start in terms of how introverts experience day-to-day life I think a good definition is one that.

00:07:10.212 --> 00:07:18.191
Some of your listeners will have heard many times before you know the idea of where do you get your energy and for some people they get their energy more from,

00:07:18.332 --> 00:07:22.404
quieter settings and for other people they get it more from being out there.

00:07:22.653 --> 00:07:32.144
So A good rule of thumb is to ask to imagine that you're at a party that you're really enjoying and you've been there for about two hours or so and it's with people you really like.

00:07:32.384 --> 00:07:35.808
And it's your favorite place it's all good.

00:07:36.156 --> 00:07:46.755
An extrovert in a setting like that is going to feel charged up and they're going to be looking for the after-party and an introvert no matter how good a time they're having and how socially skilled they are.

00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:51.526
There's this moment where you just like wish that you could teleport and be back at home.

00:07:51.739 --> 00:08:01.681
Yeah and that the time before the start of the party to the time when that moment happens is different for different people so like the shorter that is the more of a niche where you are is that that kind of thing,

00:08:01.777 --> 00:08:11.079
the shorter the moment until you get to the place where you got a Teleport oh yeah yeah and then for extroverts it's the opposite right like they're going to feel.

00:08:11.247 --> 00:08:22.035
Maybe they're working on I don't know like focused on producing a memo that's really intensely interesting to them but if they're in that state of like solitary.

00:08:22.365 --> 00:08:33.378
The solitary mode of really focusing they might get stir-crazy a lot faster than an introvert would and so it doesn't have so much to do with what you're good at as how you get your energy,

00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:44.027
and so for an introvert the source of energy is what silence Solitude and for an extrovert its interaction with other people,

00:08:44.187 --> 00:08:54.704
what I'd really say is that and this is neurobiological as well is that it has to do with how your nervous system reacts to stimulation so for an introvert,

00:08:54.863 --> 00:09:00.403
you're feeling in a great state of equilibrium when there are fewer inputs coming at you.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:09.765
So they could be social inputs but that's why an introvert in general would rather hang out with one close friend at a time as opposed to you big party full of strangers because.

00:09:10.122 --> 00:09:19.469
Too many inputs for the nervous system and for an extrovert the nervous system needs more stimulants so if they're not getting enough they get that listless and sluggish feeling.

00:09:19.656 --> 00:09:27.715
So if you're just walking through the world like a people listening to this but in general how do you know if you're an introvert.

00:09:28.298 --> 00:09:34.440
Like how do you empirically start to determine if you are in large part and introvert.

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:50.005
I would start by just asking that question of what happens to you you know it around the two-hour Mark where you're having a good time yeah like I mean imagined but I also find curious if you have a different experience from this but from all the years that I've been out there

00:09:49.957 --> 00:09:52.004
talking about this topic I found that.

00:09:52.289 --> 00:10:01.825
Most people really seem to know once they're being honest with themselves and maybe that's the question to ask is like if you imagine that you have,

00:10:01.975 --> 00:10:11.061
a Saturday or a whole weekend where you can spend your time exactly the way you want to with no professional obligations and no social obligations,

00:10:11.175 --> 00:10:19.388
who would you spend it with how many people what would you be doing and what is that picture that you're painting start to look like.

00:10:19.773 --> 00:10:26.842
Yeah so there's Nuance to this though because I'm sure for extroverts to get energized by.

00:10:27.083 --> 00:10:38.986
Stimulation whether a stimulation with other people like it depends what that stimulation is right like maybe you're not surrounded by the kind of people that you enjoy being around so you know.

00:10:39.515 --> 00:10:40.481
Um

00:10:40.838 --> 00:10:50.041
Maybe that has to do less with whether some characteristics is your personality more has to do with the fact that like what your environment is like that's always kind of

00:10:49.984 --> 00:10:59.989
the question do you want to be alone because everybody around you is an ass hole or do you want to be alone because you get energized from being well I would hold the variables constant I guess okay

00:10:59.968 --> 00:11:07.803
you know you pass was constant and c and then there's the other thing you kind of observe that there's a lot of people.

00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:12.232
They will say they get energized from being alone like.

00:11:12.625 --> 00:11:21.090
People are exhausting to them or something like that but at the same time when you see them at a party they seem like the life of the party.

00:11:21.663 --> 00:11:34.602
I know and I hear from those people all the time there's so many people like what would you classify them as exactly is It ultimately is the source of energy is the most important thing or like how the heck are they the life of the party.

00:11:34.996 --> 00:11:39.581
It's a bunch of different things you know so first of all just to say like a big

00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:54.497
caveat to all of this is humans are just amazingly complex so you can't like explain every individual human through these parameters even though I think the parameters are really valuable but that person at the party it could be that,

00:11:54.630 --> 00:12:06.921
they're more of an ambivert so they kind of in the middle of the spectrum that's it basically means someone who's not extremely introverted or extremely extroverted they're kind of in the middle so maybe at a party there more extroverted side comes out

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:15.113
or it could be an introvert who's gotten really good at the skills of acting more like a pseudo extrovert and they,

00:12:15.182 --> 00:12:23.152
pull that up at the moment that they need it so that learn how to fake it yeah oh there's a lot of people like that and I know this because.

00:12:23.338 --> 00:12:32.793
Like I think out of all the people on this planet you could be talking to you I've heard from the most number of those people like they all they all come and tell me about their experience,

00:12:32.916 --> 00:12:38.609
out in the world presenting a face that's different from what they feel so one of the things you talk about is.

00:12:38.966 --> 00:12:43.461
At least in the west have constructed a picture of success and that picture.

00:12:43.926 --> 00:12:50.482
Is usually one of an extrovert like when you imagine somebody who's a leader who's a successful person.

00:12:51.092 --> 00:12:58.053
That person has some of the qualities you would associate with an extrovert and so there's a lot of incentive.

00:12:58.366 --> 00:13:07.236
For faking it yeah exactly you will if you want to be successful you gotta be able to fake it to sort of.

00:13:07.512 --> 00:13:14.600
Hang with the rest of the team you have to have to be able to be outgoing and all those kinds of things and not be drained by the interaction.

00:13:14.813 --> 00:13:22.603
Yeah but I mean there are also a lot of introverts who figure out ways to draw on their own strengths and their incredibly.

00:13:22.789 --> 00:13:30.957
Connecting and successful and they're great leaders and they're not actually faking it they're more just figuring out ways to do it their own way,

00:13:31.107 --> 00:13:32.865
you see a lot of people like that.

00:13:33.736 --> 00:13:41.345
Is there advice is there lessons you can draw from that from just observing how you can be an introvert and be in a leadership position.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:49.123
Yeah it's kind of like a mantra figuring out what your own strengths are and how to draw on them I think of.

00:13:49.534 --> 00:14:01.744
A guy I know Doug Conant who had been the CEO of Campbell Soup for many years he's very introverted he's quite shy also by his own just description and.

00:14:01.931 --> 00:14:06.831
And he really cares about people and so when he started.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:19.443
Campbell the employee engagement ratings of the company where all the way at the bottom of the Fortune 500 and by the time he stepped down ten years later they were all the way at the top and.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:33.892
He was it wasn't that he was going out there and schmoozing people but he really did care so he would find out who are the people who had really been contributing and he would write to them personal letters of thanks.

00:14:34.168 --> 00:14:35.359
And,

00:14:35.383 --> 00:14:45.658
and people and these letters meant so much to people they would like carry them around with them and during his time the 10 years there he wrote 30,000 of those letters

00:14:45.655 --> 00:14:59.359
so like that was his way of doing it that was his way of drawing and his own strength and and you know what like he did that together was of course you sometimes have to go outside your comfort zone no matter who you are so he was doing plenty of that too yeah it's kind of combination,

00:14:59.491 --> 00:15:05.057
yeah that the writing process and focusing on the one-on-one interaction,

00:15:05.109 --> 00:15:17.706
I can definitely relate there's something deeply draining which concerns me about like Zoom meetings because it's some weird brain manipulation it's a more well because you're not really engaged.

00:15:17.919 --> 00:15:26.960
But it wears on you the same way that it does a party it feels like you're emptying that bucket for the introverts,

00:15:27.065 --> 00:15:34.837
even though they're not participating at all in the meeting and I suppose that's true for physical meetings to but with zoom meetings remote meetings

00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:49.394
it's so much easier to invite a larger number of people into the meeting so you're draining more and more of the introvert energy and I'm probably X42 but the introvert definitely there's I mean it's interesting I I would love to understand that more because there's more and more push towards

00:15:49.382 --> 00:15:50.474
remote work.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:16:03.833
Without I think a deep understanding of why these meetings are so draining on people I just anecdotally have heard from that but maybe that's because the managers the people who arranged the meetings are just not.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:15.482
Sufficiently yet aware of the draining nature of them so that they pull into many people this schedule them to regularly so they need to adjust that kind of thing probably I think people are starting to realize but.

00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:19.866
I I would say one reason that steam is so draining is because.

00:16:21.466 --> 00:16:34.837
You can see your own self presentation the whole time if you choose to and when you go into in person you can't see your kind of freed of thinking about that all those books like an extra cognitive load that your bearing.

00:16:35.014 --> 00:16:36.151
The whole time.

00:16:36.401 --> 00:16:47.548
Oh yeah like you might want to you know turn off the camera so you can't see yourself but then you feel like well I have the ability to so I probably should be doing it and then that alone is it,

00:16:47.626 --> 00:16:56.208
decision that you're making yeah there's probably studies on this now happening either have happened or are happening the effect of seeing your own.

00:16:56.584 --> 00:17:04.743
Face on camera because it's reminding you're supposed to be acting a certain way and that's that is especially a stressful thing

00:17:04.632 --> 00:17:15.095
yeah you can't be in the moment as much but I mean for you you you make the decision to do all your podcast interviews in person right and so and that's

00:17:15.092 --> 00:17:21.271
even when it's very costly if there's any kind of chemistry that contributes at all.

00:17:21.628 --> 00:17:33.865
To the conversation which I think most conversations have chemistry even the boring work meanings there's something there because yes you're trying to solve a particular problem with this particular time

00:17:33.862 --> 00:17:39.077
but underneath it there's a team building that's happening and honestly.

00:17:39.344 --> 00:17:43.957
People also have told me about this why they enjoyed the zoo meetings during,

00:17:44.107 --> 00:17:49.727
the pandemic is like they're lonely yeah like they.

00:17:50.003 --> 00:18:00.863
You know it's annoying to have to sit and listen to folks talk about nothing and so on but they tune in anyway because it's kind of lonely to sit there by yourself and that.

00:18:01.526 --> 00:18:12.278
I mean there's a deep connection there when you're with other people and that is especially true in there you were there in person which is a huge concern for me for like more and more offices.

00:18:12.464 --> 00:18:27.113
From a capitalist perspective realizing hey why are we why do we have these large office spaces why do I have to get people together but I think in some in some deep sounds we do but then you also talk about that once we do we want to protect.

00:18:27.687 --> 00:18:31.056
The introverts like you don't want the open.

00:18:31.603 --> 00:18:42.831
Space which office space which was a big fad for a while I don't know where people stand on that at this point yeah I think people are figuring it out in a post pandemic context but I mean I know what you mean.

00:18:43.342 --> 00:18:49.655
So before I became a writer I was a corporate lawyer for like seven years and,

00:18:49.814 --> 00:18:56.542
literally the only thing I miss from those years is hanging out with people,

00:18:56.665 --> 00:19:02.168
at the office like I don't know just some of the funniest moments I've had in my life came from.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:11.954
Being at the office until midnight with the other people I was working with so I know exactly what you're talking about so I will say the office is there at that firm and at most firms in those days

00:19:11.816 --> 00:19:18.660
everybody had their own office so it was like a dorm room you know it was like a long hallway everybody in their own little dorm room

00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:25.259
so you had tons of privacy but you would also come out and hang out with you so you can and I don't go home whenever you want.

00:19:25.742 --> 00:19:29.301
Yeah yeah and whenever you roam that means you're kind of open.

00:19:29.784 --> 00:19:38.654
You're looking for trouble yeah you're going for direction and the extent to which you would keep your door open you know was It Wide Open or was it half a jar just a little bit,

00:19:38.796 --> 00:19:46.729
those are all signals so is there because you said re-energized is there do you like to think and again the human mind is complicated but

00:19:46.645 --> 00:19:53.715
do you like to think of it as like a bucket that gets refilled for introverts in terms of energy of,

00:19:53.802 --> 00:20:03.429
social interaction that that that the able to handle is do you think of it like that as a bucket that gets empty and needs to be refilled

00:20:03.309 --> 00:20:16.347
I think of it yeah more or less because I use the metaphor of a battery that can be recharged or not it's basically the same thing different metaphor but yeah but just to add on that there is a layer of complexity to that because.

00:20:17.343 --> 00:20:19.615
You could be somebody who.

00:20:20.476 --> 00:20:28.374
Doesn't want the kind of social life let's say where you have to be like on and presenting and interacting with tons of people all the time

00:20:28.236 --> 00:20:35.738
but you get really lonely if you were just by yourself you know so what you want is to maybe be in the company of a couple people you know really well,

00:20:35.879 --> 00:20:49.898
like for me that pandemic was not actually that hard for me personally I mean I lost family but I mean from the point of view of what we're talking about it wasn't that hard because I live with my husband and my kids so I knew it was hard in the kids and

00:20:49.868 --> 00:20:57.100
I felt badly for them but for me I was like you know what I kind of I have a lot of social life right here in the house

00:20:56.944 --> 00:21:10.297
you may work yeah that's the cool thing about that but that pandemic I think it'd help people figure out how much they love their family that's true and and allow you give you a chance to really reconnect with kids

00:21:10.178 --> 00:21:20.173
was your kids like really spend time with them it's just fascinating to watch people actually it did strengthen the family unit and and often beautiful.

00:21:20.485 --> 00:21:30.922
Way which is sucks the mitu to have to leave behind at this point yeah and I think that's part of what people are not going to want to go back to that we need to solve for,

00:21:30.955 --> 00:21:40.689
to the extent that work becomes non remote again yeah I think people have just realized how precious those aspects of their lives are and you know for somebody who's in a.

00:21:41.271 --> 00:21:49.934
Conventional office job where you're going home and seeing your kids for an hour before bedtime and that's your interaction with them that's.

00:21:50.247 --> 00:22:04.527
That's kind of a ridiculous way to set things up it's cool to you can get I think a lot of places give you the option now which is interesting you get to optimize that element of your life you take the commute in the office working on the social interaction there or do you focus on the work at home,

00:22:04.605 --> 00:22:08.686
it's also lonely at home but then you get to see your kids if you have kids,

00:22:08.728 --> 00:22:14.889
that's part of the optimization is like I have some options now and I'm going to try to optimize.

00:22:15.741 --> 00:22:23.036
Solitude loneliness happiness productivity seeing family

00:22:22.916 --> 00:22:37.619
seeing co-workers the chemistry with the team building with the co-workers versus just the the raw exchange of information with the co-workers it's fascinating to see how that how that kind of revolves yeah and then there's the big

00:22:37.491 --> 00:22:38.817
the third space,

00:22:38.958 --> 00:22:53.058
idea of you know the spaces where you're in a co-working space or a cafe or something like that you've got other people around you but you're not exactly interacting with them but they're very much there and that's huge too

00:22:53.028 --> 00:22:57.217
we and I don't think we think about that enough yeah that energy is there.

00:22:57.386 --> 00:23:11.963
Yeah I lived in Manhattan for 17 years before we had kids and I absolutely loved it like I loved it the feeling of all that energy all around you but you could be anonymous within it.

00:23:12.257 --> 00:23:20.632
It's me was perfect he has beautiful the guy I worked this morning for a few hours programmed for a few hours at a Starbucks and first of all.

00:23:21.088 --> 00:23:29.139
Like wearing wearing suits like Manhattan is the one place you can kind of fit into that because everyone's wearing suits even looked every day,

00:23:29.281 --> 00:23:40.023
well these days unfortunate because I get recognized I wear usually not suits when I just on my own life but yeah I love it I love the way it feels I don't know

00:23:39.903 --> 00:23:48.080
and the way I think about the world are aware so I take it seriously as if my life is going to end today like this is what I would want to wear

00:23:48.014 --> 00:23:59.891
not for not physical appearance but just it for some reason makes me feel like focused I don't know so even if you're not going to see anyone you would still put the suit on when you're doing your work especially that really

00:23:59.771 --> 00:24:01.188
especially then yeah.

00:24:01.635 --> 00:24:12.341
Yeah I really I'd ever really loved doing that they're like tells you seriousness of purpose something like yeah like everything makes me do now I don't know what it is I don't know what I imagine exactly but if some kind of.

00:24:12.762 --> 00:24:18.697
Platonic form of like a mixture of James Bond and like.

00:24:19.072 --> 00:24:28.311
I don't know who else Richard Fineman can I think about when I think about it suit you know I think of Leonard Cohen but you've always wearing skirts too but you know

00:24:28.155 --> 00:24:41.455
Leonard Cohen is definitely one of my as a tragic human is a beautiful human being yeah there is words through his own private life yes I definitely would think about Leonard Cohen so.

00:24:42.838 --> 00:24:46.631
Small talk that's another thing,

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:56.092
is that part of the equation of introvert versus extrovert well how much people enjoy small talk I kind of went into this whole thing thinking that it was.

00:24:56.945 --> 00:25:01.260
From what I've seen most people have studies that most people don't like small talk,

00:25:01.365 --> 00:25:16.050
I think that's why people like your podcasts because you're like I got the small talk I'm going deep into it from the very beginning yes it's actually the picture your painting is like the way you started like with your with the book quiet.

00:25:16.606 --> 00:25:21.119
And the way you are today is you realize the picture may be more complicated.

00:25:21.593 --> 00:25:29.959
Yeah everything is more complicated I will say with the small talk thing that.

00:25:30.622 --> 00:25:40.311
I'm curious if you have this experience but I find it fantastic to have a career where
I'm known for anti small talk.

00:25:40.507 --> 00:25:49.755
Kinds of topics because it means that anywhere I go like if I show up at a conference or something like that no one does small talk with me they're like telling me about

00:25:49.599 --> 00:25:59.018
the Deep truth of their lives from the first hello and I love that and in normal life you have to Wade through a lot before you know if people are ready to go there,

00:25:59.123 --> 00:26:07.588
yeah you have that experience to know definitely definitely would people that know me for sure but you forgot how many people feel like they know you.

00:26:07.964 --> 00:26:17.203
Because of your podcast that's what noise that counts but he's Fair podcast and I feel it like before I ever became friends with Joe Rogan.

00:26:17.398 --> 00:26:22.523
I felt like I was friends with him because I was a fan of his podcast so like it was.

00:26:22.709 --> 00:26:31.976
I feel like it's a friendship I know it's a one-way friendship with all the people I listen to and podcasts and even people who are no longer with us like writers,

00:26:32.099 --> 00:26:41.059
I feel like I have a relationship with them maybe I'm insane no I totally feel that way that's the whole reason I became a writer like I'm friends with Leonard Cohen yeah,

00:26:41.218 --> 00:26:50.799
and he's not aware of it no I can't but I think that's the whole reason for writing or making music or whatever people do,

00:26:50.868 --> 00:27:01.665
it's be able to have those kinds of connections that don't require having to be in a room together because there's only so many people you can be in a room with the in your lifetime.

00:27:01.878 --> 00:27:09.641
The hard thing is is unfortunately because I value human connection so much.

00:27:10.691 --> 00:27:16.041
And I only have just like you mentioned sort of small circle of people I'm really close with.

00:27:16.534 --> 00:27:27.736
By design it always hurts me a lot to say goodbye to people hmm I can't uni people you can tell they're beautiful people they're amazing there's something so fascinating about them there are.

00:27:28.939 --> 00:27:37.980
They've had a complicated life that he could see in their eyes and the way they tell their story just a few sentences they've gone through some shit but they're also.

00:27:38.301 --> 00:27:47.243
Found some elements of beauty and then you get the realize okay well there's a fascinating human here and all you get to say is a few words here and there like a.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:54.139
Funny little joke maybe a dark joke here and there and then you just say goodbye maybe hug it out.

00:27:54.523 --> 00:28:02.637
And you go on your way so like that's a hello and a goodbye you paths will never cross again and that makes me like a sad walk,

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:16.852
fuck away but I guess I wouldn't have it any other way I suppose is the reality is in your book you talk about that sorrow that's sadness not being such a bad thing yeah and when you just said that.

00:28:17.083 --> 00:28:26.781
I just thought of this one moment in my life that I haven't thought of for 20-30 years or something but it was when I was in law school and.

00:28:27.436 --> 00:28:36.756
And a classmate of mine had his friend come to visit for the weekend and the three of us hung out a lot and we just had you know like an amazing time and,

00:28:36.888 --> 00:28:42.967
and then this other guy who wasn't going to be coming back anytime soon if at all sent a postcard to me,

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:52.096
and the only thing written on the postcard was this quote from Oscar Wilde and I don't remember the exact words but it basically said that there's no pain as intense as.

00:28:52.282 --> 00:29:01.386
The sorrow of parting from someone to whom you've just been introduced yeah there's something so intense about that and so true.

00:29:01.788 --> 00:29:07.400
I think partly also because when you've just been introduced to somebody you don't yet know.

00:29:08.009 --> 00:29:15.943
Their difficulties so you're seeing you're seeing the most sparkling version of them you're seeing like a platonic

00:29:15.796 --> 00:29:26.484
version of love and friendship and your imagination fills in the rest and some some beautiful way that matches perfectly the kind of thing you're interested in is how I feel about one scoop like one.

00:29:26.788 --> 00:29:36.216
Spoonful of ice cream and that's why you always finish the whole tub and you regret all of it you do you do say what did you write this.

00:29:36.501 --> 00:29:43.463
I think this is on your website that one of the best things in the world is that Sublime moment when a writer artist or musician

00:29:43.262 --> 00:29:54.283
manages to express something you've always felt but never articulated or at least never quite so beautifully so that's the Squall line is one line like that but just a line

00:29:54.146 --> 00:29:55.463
from a song.

00:29:56.144 --> 00:30:05.095
Or maybe a piece of art that just grabs user something that jumps out into memory like that for you I don't know if I have an exact line though,

00:30:05.101 --> 00:30:18.157
I mean that feeling that you just quoted happens to me all the time I'm just bad at recalling exact instances that on the spot but the writer a lendable tongue regularly makes me feel that way,

00:30:18.263 --> 00:30:26.701
he's just this beautiful essayist and like Observer of human nature and he's just constantly expressing things and this gorgeous way.

00:30:27.355 --> 00:30:30.347
That you've experienced yourself and you feel like.

00:30:30.515 --> 00:30:40.879
It's just this Grand Act of generosity you know you feel less lonely feel a deep sense of communion it's such an elevating experience even when it's like a Melancholy line.

00:30:41.578 --> 00:30:47.226
Maybe especially when it is it what is that there's a.

00:30:47.673 --> 00:31:01.395
So the Jack Kerouac on the road definitely makes me feel that way like every other line in their forlorn Rags of growing old you know I never read that book so what was it about that book that made you feel that way.

00:31:02.113 --> 00:31:08.435
Well okay well since you asked I didn't tell you I'm going to linger on this.

00:31:08.648 --> 00:31:18.374
So this is story is he's kind of the book The the kind of defining book of the of the beets be generation and.

00:31:18.749 --> 00:31:25.602
Basically story of a writer who takes a road trip across the United States a couple of times,

00:31:25.663 --> 00:31:34.073
and experiences a few close friends and a few strangers along the way and there's a lot of just those Melancholy goodbyes along the way

00:31:34.035 --> 00:31:44.840
you meet all these people with interesting lives some of them are defined by struggle some of them are defined by drugs drinking women all that kind of stuff and still he just kind of

00:31:44.747 --> 00:31:54.185
dances around all of that and it's defined by the goodbyes and the passing of time so a lot of the really powerful lines are basically like,

00:31:54.245 --> 00:31:57.840
there's that one on there again I don't remember exactly but he meets.

00:31:58.845 --> 00:32:04.609
A beautiful girl at a restaurant and the girl.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:12.468
Is getting or woman's getting on a different bus than he's getting on and so it's that like.

00:32:12.663 --> 00:32:16.672
Feeling of falling in love for like.

00:32:16.858 --> 00:32:31.544
A second and realizing that like fate is just ripping that out we just similar to this idea of it sucks to say goodbye just when you met but it's especially true when you fall in love just a little bit with a stranger with the.

00:32:31.766 --> 00:32:37.251
With the all the possibilities that could lay there so there's a few lines of.

00:32:37.951 --> 00:32:42.932
Went down just because I went on this whole Rabbit Hole of thinking one of the lines that grabbed me.

00:32:43.334 --> 00:32:52.915
A couple of miles from on the road so one is what is that feeling when you're driving away from people and they recede on the plane till you see the respects dispersing,

00:32:53.057 --> 00:33:05.690
it's the two huge World vaulting us and it's goodbye but we lean forward to the next crazy Venture beneath the skies so this is him talking about leaving a particular City the spoiler alert towards the end of the book,

00:33:05.822 --> 00:33:15.322
rather the end of the book line ever turned too often
it's more poetry but it's a feeling that captures the book I would say,

00:33:15.337 --> 00:33:26.926
the evening star must be drooping and shedding her sparkler dims on the Prairie which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the Earth darkens all the rivers.

00:33:27.112 --> 00:33:37.405
Cups the Peaks and folds the final show Aaron and nobody nobody knows what's going to happen to anybody besides the forlorn Rags of growing old.

00:33:37.591 --> 00:33:44.210
And it just captures this kind of in the moment appreciation of the beauty of the world.

00:33:44.811 --> 00:33:54.275
And a sadness over the fact that time passes and you leave the people you love behind you leave the places you love behind or at least the way they were,

00:33:54.398 --> 00:34:03.682
at the time that you really enjoyed them and you just leave that all that just just the sadness you feel when you read something about it like look at her picture look into your kids grow up

00:34:03.508 --> 00:34:07.715
looking at Old Friends getting old something makes you realize.

00:34:08.027 --> 00:34:17.861
Time passes and somewhere deep in there is probably a realization of your mortality and then you just makes you somehow for sad that everything.

00:34:18.092 --> 00:34:20.508
Comes to an end and then.

00:34:20.847 --> 00:34:33.228
That's immediately followed by sort of an appreciation of the Moment Like A gratitude that you get to experience this moment yeah I know it exactly I mean that's that's the whole reason that I wrote bittersweet.

00:34:33.513 --> 00:34:38.359
It's all about that so I know intensely what you're talking about and

00:34:38.302 --> 00:34:46.155
by the way my husband loves the book A moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway which I also haven't read but it talks about that same thing you know groups of

00:34:46.008 --> 00:34:53.357
people traveling around together and the group coalesces into some magical formation and then one person leaves the group and,

00:34:53.516 --> 00:34:58.920
it's never going to be the same again and then they move on to the next one yeah I mean,

00:34:59.061 --> 00:35:04.475
I think that's the deepest essence of human nature.

00:35:04.652 --> 00:35:17.060
The feeling of longing for some kind of state of perfect complete completeness completion perfect love the Garden of Eden all of it and the feeling that.

00:35:17.534 --> 00:35:21.849
You're never going to quite attain it but you get glimpses of it here and there and that

00:35:21.693 --> 00:35:35.073
there's glimpses or some of the best things that ever happened to us and there's a fused with sadness because they're not the real thing or they're not the full thing they're just a glimpse there's a it's a glimpse of what we long for so the sadness

00:35:34.953 --> 00:35:36.388
that we might feel.

00:35:36.781 --> 00:35:45.660
Is always connected to the ways in which we fall short from the perfect thing that were like there's always the thing you're longing for.

00:35:46.377 --> 00:35:52.529
And the sadness has to do with the getting a glimpse of it but not quite getting a hold of it.

00:35:52.895 --> 00:36:01.018
Yeah it's always always losing its always losing but it's also always that but it's not that sounds really depressing but it's.

00:36:01.222 --> 00:36:05.582
It's not you know it's not pressing because you experience this all the time it's also.

00:36:06.038 --> 00:36:19.031
Those are the most beautiful moments I think life offers I mean it's intense intense Beauty in those moments because it's getting closer to the real thing that we long for so what about.

00:36:19.209 --> 00:36:22.200
Mike loss losing love.

00:36:22.512 --> 00:36:31.806
Is that also a beautiful thing well the moment you're talking about,

00:36:31.947 --> 00:36:40.448
I think it's easier to appreciate the beauty of it all in the moment because you're experiencing,

00:36:40.607 --> 00:36:52.790
you're kind of experiencing the loss and the love all at the same time whereas if you're talking about straight up loss like a betrayal or a bereavement or whatever it is that's.

00:36:53.489 --> 00:37:01.153
It's different it's quite overwhelming so losing loved one kind of thing losing a loved one I mean I will say that.

00:37:01.789 --> 00:37:09.696
The truth that I think that we can come to after a lot of time on this Earth is the idea that.

00:37:10.305 --> 00:37:17.555
Love exists not only in its particular forms so not only in the form of the one person.

00:37:17.876 --> 00:37:20.886
You know that one person we love or that other person we love.

00:37:21.162 --> 00:37:32.022
Love itself is a state that we have access to and so over time the loss of person a can heal and you can tap into.

00:37:32.208 --> 00:37:44.895
Bigger River of Love yeah I mean I had this system comes from Louie Louie c.k. in a show damn I love that line I mean there's a he's talks to an older gentleman.

00:37:45.549 --> 00:37:50.800
And Louise is all like sad about.

00:37:51.689 --> 00:37:58.615
Losing a loved one or like getting rejected essentially like a breakup hmm and then the the older gentleman.

00:37:59.017 --> 00:38:08.814
Give them advice saying like basically criticizes Louis for saying why are you moping around because this is the most this is the best part.

00:38:09.117 --> 00:38:14.611
Like losing love is the best part because it that's the real loss is when you forget.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:19.392
Like feeling shitty about having gone through a breakup.

00:38:20.856 --> 00:38:29.762
Is when you most intensely appreciate what that person meant to you mmm thank you most intensely feel loving someone.

00:38:30.165 --> 00:38:38.971
Strange Way by realizing that you've lost it by missing it wishing at this moment I wish I had that like that feeling.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:51.323
That that's when you feel that love the most the absence of it so the the older gentleman gives advice that that that's the best part and it can if you're good with it it can last for the longest.

00:38:51.995 --> 00:38:54.528
It could be the most sort of.

00:38:54.921 --> 00:39:05.375
Prolonged the experience of deep appreciation and emotion and so on so that that's kind of that's a nice way to look at Los.

00:39:05.958 --> 00:39:15.512
Which is a reminder of how much somebody meant to us yeah I mean I think there's a lot of Truth in that because.

00:39:15.905 --> 00:39:28.952
Yeah you wouldn't care so much if it weren't something that mattered to you so it's always a signpost to the direction you really want to go to and that's always what it is yeah it's interesting to see the way the,

00:39:29.111 --> 00:39:32.310
the mystical versions of.

00:39:32.766 --> 00:39:43.410
Many of the Great religions all point in this direction you know whether you were looking at Sufism or or the Kabbalah or in Christian mysticism you see this idea that.

00:39:43.785 --> 00:39:45.859
The longing for what you lack,

00:39:45.973 --> 00:39:59.416
is the very thing that gives you what you're longing for so the longing is the cure I mean that's that's the way the Sufi poet Rumi puts it the longing is the cure you know and he says be thirsty like be as thirsty as you possibly can.

00:39:59.584 --> 00:40:03.593
That's what you want to be the good stuff is the one thing that the having,

00:40:03.689 --> 00:40:17.817
yeah yeah of course thoughts a person I just broke up and they'll be like shut up asshole devices sucks I wish I had her him back yeah I know absolutely.

00:40:18.156 --> 00:40:29.312
Those are the kinds of life lessons that only work when you kind of step away for a while they don't work in the moment in the moment of excruciation there is something about the fact of.

00:40:29.679 --> 00:40:37.279
Knowing that all humans are in that experience together that is also incredibly uplifting.

00:40:37.493 --> 00:40:43.698
Well that takes time for people to realize like you know like heartbreak.

00:40:44.082 --> 00:40:52.844
In your early teenage years or something like that could feel like this is the completely the most novel yes in the most dramatic.

00:40:53.013 --> 00:41:03.809
Pain that any human has ever felt right or maybe even when you're younger and then one of the process one of the things you realize is that everybody goes through this

00:41:03.716 --> 00:41:07.707
they can be an Awakening to the fact that we're all in this together

00:41:07.587 --> 00:41:16.205
this Human Condition is not just a personal experience the experience who all share and that's that's the kind of love the unity of it

00:41:16.058 --> 00:41:25.432
yeah you can get to experience really deep kind of love and I feel like you know where we are prevented from perceiving that love as.

00:41:25.655 --> 00:41:32.589
It's actually like the most obvious kind of love and it's right there and it happens all the time but were prevented from perceiving it because we're not really supposed to

00:41:32.442 --> 00:41:40.890
talk about things like that it's like there's something unseemly about it well it's also in the west is this of individualist society so like

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:47.119
there's a pressure to sort of see the individual as a distinct Sovereign entity.

00:41:47.854 --> 00:41:57.372
That experience is things is that the unity between people is not it's not obviously sort of communicated or talked about or is part of the culture.

00:41:57.685 --> 00:42:08.085
Yeah it's not part of the culture and yet you know you see it in our behaviors because we're humans so you know why do people listen to sad music I mean one reason is,

00:42:08.154 --> 00:42:14.153
they're hearing expressed for them like the musician is basically saying to them this thing that,

00:42:14.186 --> 00:42:21.372
you have experienced I've experienced it to still have lots of other people and but they're saying it all without words and it's,

00:42:21.505 --> 00:42:30.186
transformed into something beautiful and there's something about that that's just incredibly elevating I people don't know it but.

00:42:31.029 --> 00:42:35.569
Okay there's one study that I have in Bittersweet the found that

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:50.513
people whose favorite songs are there happy songs play it on their playlist about 175 times the people who love sad music play them about 800 times and they say that they feel connected to the sublime when

00:42:50.474 --> 00:43:01.910
when they're listening to that music what do you think that is so what is that what what is it in music that connects us to the sublime through sadness.

00:43:02.924 --> 00:43:07.806
I mean I have a bunch of different theories like the whole reason I started.

00:43:08.155 --> 00:43:16.079
Writing this book is because I kept having this reaction reliably to sad music and,

00:43:16.239 --> 00:43:27.368
I realized that for people who I knew who were religious Believers the way they describe their experience of God was what I was experiencing when I would hear that music.

00:43:27.735 --> 00:43:41.664
Like all the time it happens over and over again so you wonder what that is and yeah so I started wondering what that is and lots of people have tried to figure out you know what that's all about,

00:43:41.724 --> 00:43:50.927
and there are different theories that it's expressing it's like a kind of catharsis for our difficult emotions that it's as we were saying expensive

00:43:50.915 --> 00:43:57.247
being in it together
we don't react in that sort of uplifted way,

00:43:57.262 --> 00:44:06.438
when you just see like a slideshow of sad faces which is something researchers have actually tested no one really cares when there seems like the sad faces,

00:44:06.516 --> 00:44:19.077
but the sad music they're really reacting and also they don't really react when they're hearing music expressing other negative emotions like martial music or something like that it's just the sad music that gives people with elevated sense of wonder.

00:44:19.399 --> 00:44:27.233
So I think it's the combination of the sadness and the beauty and I think it's just tapping into.

00:44:28.014 --> 00:44:37.289
The essence of the human source code which is a kind of spiritual longing whether we're atheists are believers there's this feeling of longing for

00:44:37.124 --> 00:44:53.079
a state and a place of perfect love and perfect unity and perfect truth and all of it and I like an acute awareness that we're not there in this world and you know in religions we express that through the longing for Mecca or Eden or Zion.

00:44:53.778 --> 00:44:56.059
And artistically express it with.

00:44:56.407 --> 00:45:10.957
Darcy longing for somewhere over the rainbow or you know Harry Potter enters the story at the precise moment that he's become an orphan so he's now going to spend the rest of his life longing for these parents who he can never remember

00:45:10.909 --> 00:45:12.983
and that's,

00:45:13.097 --> 00:45:23.300
there's something about that state that's at our very core and I think that's why we love it so much well it could be you know you can have the Ernest Becker theory of denial of death where

00:45:23.153 --> 00:45:35.191
at the core of that the warm of the core as young said is the fear of death so we're the longing for the perfect thing is has to do with

00:45:35.036 --> 00:45:40.278
sort of becoming Immortal as reaching.

00:45:41.031 --> 00:45:48.110
Beyond the the absurdity the cruelty of life that all things come to an end for.

00:45:48.467 --> 00:45:57.679
Front for no particularly good reason whatsoever when we can rationally explain I know you know I wonder about that all the time like.

00:45:58.225 --> 00:46:08.644
I know obviously there's that idea from Becker and throughout philosophy and the tale of Gilgamesh about the idea that the thing we're longing for most of all is immortality but.

00:46:09.712 --> 00:46:12.506
I feel like it's not only that I think it's.

00:46:14.682 --> 00:46:23.327
More so are also let's say a longing for the Lions to lay down with the Lambs finally you know for like the,

00:46:23.378 --> 00:46:34.345
the fundamental calculus of the universe to just be different where life doesn't have to eat life in order to survive and yeah just a completely different situation I want that that.

00:46:34.586 --> 00:46:40.170
Immortality would not solve I wonder that could be a very kind of.

00:46:42.237 --> 00:46:56.356
Modern thing because surely so much of human history is defined by violence and glorified violence that doesn't give inklings of this Lions and the Lambs so much.

00:46:56.551 --> 00:47:09.850
We have women I mean I know all the other stuff is in the Bible to you there's other stuff in the Bible and the Bible is this that particular aspect doesn't necessarily revealed the fundamental motivation of human nature that could be deeper stuff

00:47:09.757 --> 00:47:15.080
you know but yeah that is a beautiful that is a beautiful picture but.

00:47:15.474 --> 00:47:21.472
Is it just about humans there's it all about but all of life and you have to think about.

00:47:22.487 --> 00:47:29.016
What is the perfect world look like it's not just the lines in the Lambs laying together,

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:36.767
is you know how many lines is how many Labs right and you know what having just

00:47:36.575 --> 00:47:59.570
had a few very technical conversation about marxian economics versus Kenzie and economics versus neoclassical economics what is the economic and the government system look like for the Lions and the labs that we're longing for so that then you start to build Society on top of all those things and you but you still you return to this what it what is it what are we longing for

00:47:59.405 --> 00:48:02.531
what's the role of love in that what's the role of,

00:48:02.682 --> 00:48:10.750
that's sad Melancholy feeling the feeling of loneliness is the feeling of loneliness fundamental to The Human Condition like.

00:48:10.991 --> 00:48:15.774
We are always striving to sort of channel that feeling of loneliness.

00:48:16.644 --> 00:48:24.596
To connect with others like we want that feeling of aloneness otherwise we wouldn't be connecting is that fundamental that feeling like.

00:48:25.115 --> 00:48:38.595
You're alone in this even when you're with other people so it alone together you're born alone you die alone maybe loneliness is fundamental I think the longing for Union is fundamental it's just that it looks so different for different people you know

00:48:38.502 --> 00:48:44.059
yeah I'm coming back to where we were what we were talking about at the beginning you know.

00:48:44.326 --> 00:48:51.756
Union looks incredibly social for a lot of people and hardly social at all for others but everybody needs some version of Union.

00:48:52.383 --> 00:49:01.848
Yeah people have been telling me recently about polyamory and all those kinds of things some having probably grown up in a certain part of the world I'm very I got,

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:11.543
very monogamy Centric none of judgmental wages for me what makes me happy is one person for though for my whole life basically just dedication,

00:49:11.567 --> 00:49:18.115
yeah because I've just seen through relationships with people and objects in my life.

00:49:18.733 --> 00:49:24.587
The longer we stay together the deeper the tie mmm so.

00:49:25.566 --> 00:49:37.749
That's just a empirical thing and yes that probably is a personalized thing that's just true for me it could be very different for others maybe it's connected to the introverted thing maybe not.

00:49:40.122 --> 00:49:49.460
Who knows that before before I leave because you mentioned songs sad songs what what are we talking about what's a good what what song do you remember last crying.

00:49:50.502 --> 00:49:57.419
Oh gosh well I mean that's you know I thought I literally dedicated.

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:09.995
My book to Leonard Cohen he's played such a huge role in my life like I love him I love him and I loved him with his crazy love that I've never been able to understand for decades,

00:50:10.136 --> 00:50:25.172
I think I understand a little better now but so you guys so you're better friends with him than me I'm just so does it make you is it the musician or the human to because the human is a is a tortured soul in a way

00:50:24.981 --> 00:50:32.770
I'd say it's the musician it's a musician I actually was thinking about this the other day I mean obviously he's not alive anymore but.

00:50:33.083 --> 00:50:46.121
I was kind of running the thought experiment you know if you were alive still and I had the chance to meet him in person would I want to do that and I'm not really sure that I would because.

00:50:46.442 --> 00:50:51.603
He represents for me symbolically everything.

00:50:52.194 --> 00:50:59.381
Well everything else and the sentence right there and so and I think that's okay and I think people can,

00:50:59.504 --> 00:51:06.277
can express something through their art that they might or might not express if you were just like hanging out with them and having a coffee.

00:51:18.859 --> 00:51:26.793
Like a focus of remembering of like a deep focus of connection that's why when I interact with folks.

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:36.696
It's so draining for me because I'm putting all my whatever weapons I got in terms of like deeply.

00:51:36.981 --> 00:51:49.947
Try to understand the person in front of me and doing that dance of human interaction the the humor the intense kind of delving into who they are so it which requires like me.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:54.610
Navigating around like small talk type of stuff and

00:51:54.562 --> 00:52:01.308
and just like compliments and so on in general it could be people depending on the culture depending on the place they'll sometimes

00:52:01.071 --> 00:52:09.581
flower stuff was smiling and like compliments like oh yeah I love you this is great but the like this that's all great but you want to get to the core of like

00:52:09.434 --> 00:52:15.603
what are the demons in the closet let's talk about it you know and that could be exhausting,

00:52:15.636 --> 00:52:24.371
they can be really exhausting so from a letter code perspective you get more and more famous it can be hard sometimes because he probably also an introvert.

00:52:24.585 --> 00:52:39.504
Yeah I know he was an introvert because he actually tweeted about my book when it came out so that was a precious moment for me something about we should all be listening to the quiet I can't remember exactly what he said but yeah yeah no he definitely was.

00:52:39.754 --> 00:52:47.291
He struggled with depression which I wonder if that's something that's also connected to introversion

00:52:47.261 --> 00:52:57.329
but perhaps not actually perhaps that they're very disjoint and and also connected to sensitivity and many sensitive people are introverts so it's kind of like a Venn diagram

00:52:57.263 --> 00:53:04.341
about 80% of highly sensitive people are introverted but then some are extroverts and then not all introverts are sensitive

00:53:04.276 --> 00:53:10.526
so it's complicated but he was definitely a sensitive type well there's on top of that you see like.

00:53:10.991 --> 00:53:22.427
The percent of artist relative to the average of suffer from depression so creative people oh yes very high very very crazy yeah and then the number of artists and successful artists who were orphaned,

00:53:22.496 --> 00:53:30.493
when they were young who lost one parent or both parents like an astronomical number I have it in the book and remember the percentage but huge,

00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:36.336
and he was one of them he lost his father when he was 9 and his First Act of poetry was.

00:53:37.197 --> 00:53:47.318
Was he took his father made suits that's why I thought of him when we were talking about you and and he took one of his father's bowties and wrote a poem.

00:53:47.514 --> 00:53:54.610
In his honor and buried the poem and the bow tie in the back yard and that was like his first creative act.

00:53:54.823 --> 00:54:02.496
You know that song Chelsea Hotel number to sure where he met I guess it's about Janis Joplin yeah.

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.907
What a fun intense,

00:54:06.959 --> 00:54:23.175
and cruel person she is so I guess have you ever seen I'm sorry to interrupt you but have you ever seen his son Adam cone and Lana Del Rey perform that song together oh no incredible I have to send it to you

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:25.902
yeah so that for people who don't know I don't,

00:54:25.989 --> 00:54:35.238
I mean maybe I don't know it goes I remember you well on the Chelsea Hotel you're talking so brave and so sweet giving me head,

00:54:35.397 --> 00:54:45.005
on the unmade bed while The Limousines weighed in the street that's a good line in there about about being ugly

00:54:44.903 --> 00:54:57.185
yeah we are ugly but we have the music no before that from a guy's perspective it was oh you told me again you preferred handsome man but for me you would make an exception yeah

00:54:57.038 --> 00:55:04.252
so good will she continue that thread in later because I think he said that he was lousy in bed.

00:55:04.690 --> 00:55:12.318
I was that right yeah she publicly said that which is like man this they're just.

00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:23.985
Okay for people don't know I think this is a true story about them interacting and and being together for a very brief time I don't know dating but just connecting falling in love or.

00:55:24.189 --> 00:55:37.029
In this only in this very particular way that I think famous musicians poets Can-Can which is like it's impossible for that kind of thing to last but they they did for brief.

00:55:37.665 --> 00:55:46.445
Moment is like a sadness to it because it's so momentarily but it's so epic yeah these

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:55.745
two paths Crossing you just look at the we know these famous people and it's really interesting to watch yeah you don't even have the impression that they're thinking it's going to last

00:55:55.508 --> 00:56:05.395
they more know that it's like a blaze of an intersection yeah and the The Limousines already waiting while they're in the moment in the middle of it and then it's done

00:56:05.338 --> 00:56:09.860
yeah and he talked about how his music.

00:56:10.299 --> 00:56:23.093
He said he said something like some people are more inclined to say hello with her music but I'm rather more valedictory that's what he said what is Valedictorian saying goodbye like this valedictorians address.

00:56:23.388 --> 00:56:24.399
Interesting.

00:56:25.521 --> 00:56:38.326
You know it's so many of his songs really are about some form of parting or goodbye or an imperfection or something or like the Broken Hallelujah yeah that's the thing that's so.

00:56:38.845 --> 00:56:40.585
Incredible about him.

00:56:41.248 --> 00:56:50.082
Is the
is the way that he's taking all of that and pointing it in the direction of transcendence like it's not.

00:56:50.431 --> 00:56:58.301
It's not just pure sadness its sadness and beauty and that's the thing yeah there is a feeling of transcendence and a lot of the songs.

00:56:58.848 --> 00:57:03.028
It's like sadness and Transcendence he writes a goodbye.

00:57:04.339 --> 00:57:14.010
But you're moving on to some bigger thing but in a sort of ethereal way like not like a proud arrogant way.

00:57:14.557 --> 00:57:23.661
Yeah so his favorite poet was a Garcia Lorca he actually named his daughter after him his daughter's name is Lorca and.

00:57:24.063 --> 00:57:32.438
And he talked about how
there's some poem that Lorca had written that made him realize that.

00:57:32.831 --> 00:57:42.665
The universe itself was aching but the ache was okay because that's the way you embrace the Sun and the Moon
I mean that's what I think is.

00:57:43.616 --> 00:57:48.795
That's why I think there's this whole Rich vein in this.

00:57:49.134 --> 00:57:58.833
Bittersweet tradition that he embodies that's like the essence of beauty you know it's the way you embrace the Sun and the Moon
the song Hallelujah return to that often.

00:57:59.712 --> 00:58:07.241
Have been me to play it I've now friend who wants to sing it with me this thing ER.

00:58:07.409 --> 00:58:16.072
Hmm what is when somebody says they're a singer do they have to be good

00:58:15.979 --> 00:58:24.750
because then no but I would say yes I was in a band for a while I sang for a while I was always bad but I enjoy it.

00:58:25.009 --> 00:58:33.185
I enjoy I enjoy lyrics I enjoy words yeah one sung or spoken they capture something they could get in that moment

00:58:33.183 --> 00:58:37.768
Tom Waits is a huge favorite of mine for that reason

00:58:37.729 --> 00:58:49.623
although he often his lyrics are often not that not that simple I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy he's always playing with just like,

00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:55.871
these weird word play that's especially in the English language just,

00:58:55.967 --> 00:59:04.063
trickier to do I'm fortunate enough to know another language which is Russian so I get to understand the certain languages allow for more world,

00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:11.130
wordplay that others English for that reason I don't think has a like.

00:59:11.901 --> 00:59:17.927
Like a like a culture of you know what I mean to push back on what I'm about to say but there was no.

00:59:18.212 --> 00:59:31.727
Culture of word play until hip-hop came along hmm so like like distorting words in interesting ways for there to be a rhythm rhyme,

00:59:31.814 --> 00:59:37.632
and the same time you capturing some really powerful message plus humor,

00:59:37.639 --> 00:59:50.398
all that makes that actually hip hop does it does a really good job of this but there wasn't a tradition if you look at poetry in the 20th century that wasn't really a tradition of that in the United States but there was in other parts of the world and certainly in Russia

00:59:50.278 --> 00:59:58.563
interesting empowered also not just by Language by the fact that you go through a World War where tens of millions of people died something about Mass

00:59:58.398 --> 01:00:03.505
Mass death of civilians that inspires great literature and music and art,

01:00:03.619 --> 01:00:15.667
yeah absolutely because you start telling the real truth I think yes this is there's no more reason for small talk that's funny I always have thought that.

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:20.078
If I could choose any other medium besides writing it would be singing

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:33.510
but then the singer no I mean like I'm really not I just love the idea of it but then I also think you know fundamentally a shy person so I think it's much better that my medium is writing instead of singing so like it all worked out,

01:00:33.651 --> 01:00:40.783
that said you also an exceptionally good public speaker and you're not supposed to be

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:54.422
mathematically speaking mathematically speaking you're not supposed to be a good public speaker Oh you mean because of shyness or yeah because the shine is because of introversion because of all those kinds of things oh yeah but lots of introverts are public speakers actually

01:00:54.338 --> 01:01:00.048
like this is one of I knew this from the studies but then also when I started going out on the lecture circuit

01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:08.097
I realized that all my fellow speakers at all these conferences I was going through there all introverts because you know they're all people who like spent years.

01:01:08.265 --> 01:01:20.870
Figuring out some idea and now they're out there talking about it though they're in their head figuring out the idea yeah how do you explain how do you explain that the the public speakers would you say the good public speakers are usually introverts,

01:01:20.949 --> 01:01:25.120
no I think there's just different styles of it and I think that we just have,

01:01:25.234 --> 01:01:31.970
when we hear the word public speaker we have a really limited idea of who that person would be,

01:01:32.067 --> 01:01:41.405
for me I like I used to be very phobic about public speaking and part of the reason for it was because I thought that being the kind of person I was.

01:01:42.311 --> 01:01:50.128
Didn't equal being able to be a good public speaker because you're only imagining you know like the super kind of out there Showman.

01:01:50.359 --> 01:01:56.178
But I think there's another style of public speaking that's more reflective and

01:01:56.148 --> 01:02:09.087
thoughtful and conveying ideas and people like that too is there advice you can give on how to overcome that like if you're a shy person to be a public speaker I can totally give that advice because

01:02:09.084 --> 01:02:17.630
I used to before I would give speeches you know if I had to do it in law school if I knew like today was the day when I was going to get called on in a law school class,

01:02:17.663 --> 01:02:24.778
I literally went I'm vomited on my way to class like that bound her wrists I used to be and.

01:02:25.108 --> 01:02:33.906
Yeah the way to do it is through desensitization you know it's like been figured out it's the way to overcome any fear you have to expose yourself to the thing you fear.

01:02:34.155 --> 01:02:36.084
But in very small doses.

01:02:36.271 --> 01:02:48.913
So you can't start by giving the Ted Talk you have to start II started by going to this class for people with public speaking anxiety where the first day all we had to do is stand up and say our name,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.830
and the down I like that's the victory.

01:02:52.052 --> 01:03:03.550
That's fun to watch all those people exactly T just okay that's the first step in the step one step at a time yeah and then like with this class you go back the next week and,

01:03:03.692 --> 01:03:10.761
and he would have us come to the front of the room and stand up with other people standing next to us yeah so that

01:03:10.623 --> 01:03:20.151
you didn't have the feeling of being all alone in the spotlight through others sharing it with you and you would answer some questions about where'd you grow up you know where do you go to school

01:03:20.094 --> 01:03:28.847
and you declare Victory and you're done and then little by little by little you keep ratcheting up the exercises until you get to the point where you can do it

01:03:28.781 --> 01:03:33.456
and then you start having successes and you realize oh you know actually I can do this

01:03:33.453 --> 01:03:39.091
what about like writing versus improvising because I knew a few people

01:03:39.026 --> 01:03:44.133
the colleagues of mine that were working on TED talks and feels like.

01:03:44.346 --> 01:03:52.505
You're supposed to like right the thing like way ahead of time and you practice it and they can help you and all that kind of stuff I don't think I've ever

01:03:52.340 --> 01:04:00.364
practice the speech once in my life or a lecture or any of that like I know it's really good to do but is what do you find,

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:09.276
that release some of the anxiety preparing well or are you not able to do not preparing well at all I definitely like to prepare.

01:04:10.164 --> 01:04:24.175
Before but the kind of preparation that I've done for my TED Talks is completely different from what I've done for everything else because TED Talks are more like a theatrical event where it's like a one-person show and of course if you were

01:04:24.163 --> 01:04:28.982
I'm going to go and Broadway with a monologue you would know every word so it's kind of like that

01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:38.461
and so I would rehearse it over and over the way you do that isn't that more anxiety knowing every single word it's so much anxiety because yeah your

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:48.067
you're not even so freaked out about being on stage so much as what if I forget something yeah yeah absolutely I mean if they do things like the last Ted Talk I gave,

01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:57.564
I actually did forget something halfway through like I just couldn't remember the next line and so I had to walk over like over there where my notes yeah and.

01:04:58.156 --> 01:05:11.356
So I did that and the audience like very kindly clapped well I did that and then I came back to the spotlight and kept going and they edit that out no your dad there's a failure modes it's okay it seems really

01:05:11.209 --> 01:05:16.631
it seems really stressful like I'm now I'm not sure if I'll ever publish it but.

01:05:17.447 --> 01:05:23.563
I've been most is for personal Journey but I've been working on.

01:05:23.956 --> 01:05:41.675
A series on wait for it Hitler in the Third Reich so of looking at the historical context of everything because of my family was so much affected by that whole part of History so for me to rigorously I've read a lot about Stalin and Hitler and for me too

01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:47.248
Force must one of the best ways to force yourself to really consider material it's a have to,

01:05:47.254 --> 01:05:53.819
talk about it totally yeah so that's why I'm doing it but I'm playing with ideas of.

01:05:54.105 --> 01:05:59.347
Some of it may be like twenty percent is written down on paper.

01:05:59.614 --> 01:06:05.477
But the rest of it is my thoughts in the moment that's a difficult balance.

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:11.158
The strike is the if you write a lot you're going to be more precise you going to be more accurate.

01:06:11.407 --> 01:06:18.198
But you're going to miss some of the deep like honest emotion the silence is won't be.

01:06:18.483 --> 01:06:24.868
Correct or the silences between the words won't capture.

01:06:25.937 --> 01:06:34.564
The depth of feeling unless if you're somebody like me if you're like I Guess That's What actors and actresses have to do like.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:49.444
Basically even though the script is fully written you improvise between the word between the lines yeah that's a skill well it also takes so much time I mean I experienced that with the TED Talks it's like,

01:06:49.586 --> 01:06:55.746
you get your stage so you're memorizing everything word-for-word and at first in that process

01:06:55.626 --> 01:07:07.026
it comes out in a really wooden way the way you're saying like the emotions gone but once you really know it so you've internalized the words then all the emotion comes back and you can stay them in a completely different way

01:07:06.906 --> 01:07:16.649
you know when you're really speaking it from the heart but you have to know it so well before you can do that most of I would never recommend it because it's just like it's so time-consuming

01:07:16.583 --> 01:07:26.939
it's an inch well it in your case it works out beautiful like when it when it all comes together it is a theatrical thing it's like a musical or whatever.

01:07:27.179 --> 01:07:35.995
I'm going to think I'm going to come out with a one-man show on Broadway singing now I'm inspired for Real where are you going

01:07:35.938 --> 01:07:42.261
where are you going to talk about Hitler and Stalin and everything you're learning to have you ever thought of.

01:07:42.573 --> 01:07:48.040
Using the medium of just speaking into a microphone but without the video.

01:07:48.974 --> 01:07:57.088
I'm curious about this because like I fell in love with podcasts originally before there was ever this whole video component to it

01:07:57.004 --> 01:08:03.236
and I realized there's something so Primal and magical about having someone's voice in your ear

01:08:03.089 --> 01:08:09.600
my favorite kinds of interviews still very few people do it this way nowadays but my favorite kind Darwin.

01:08:09.949 --> 01:08:13.427
You're just talking into the microphone so it's not over Zoom.

01:08:13.973 --> 01:08:21.321
It's not in person it's just you in the microphone and the other person in the microphone and they're in your ear it's like the ultimate in intimacy.

01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:30.540
Oh you mean from the interviewer perspective this yeah ever yeah but I but it would be interesting also is with the kind of thing you're talking about of just speaking

01:08:30.465 --> 01:08:39.749
like just you in the mic I would love to be in person but you can't see the person I wonder what that's like good family mean like they're all there but behind a curtain ourselves your eyes closed,

01:08:39.881 --> 01:08:52.352
talking you have your eyes closed or whatever you have because I think you still have get the same kind of chemistry because it's not just the visual that I don't even know that because obviously I have trouble making I got that

01:08:52.242 --> 01:09:00.013
but as I don't know if the visual stimulation is the necessary thing there's something about the way audio travels that captures the intimacy,

01:09:00.037 --> 01:09:05.721
were some people actually have headphones on like Joe does this have headphones on that's really intimate.

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:14.327
Like there's something about that sound going directly into your ear yeah yeah there is something Primal there yeah for sure I've.

01:09:14.936 --> 01:09:21.024
I've thought about it definitely is some of my favorite podcasts are like that WTF with Marc Maron

01:09:20.869 --> 01:09:29.946
that's Audio Only this does a few Audio Only podcast that I just love and what is that I've I still go on clubhouse that that was a,

01:09:30.042 --> 01:09:35.005
let's social media platform rates Audio Only and so interesting that people,

01:09:35.083 --> 01:09:41.100
the interesting thing about Clubhouse in particular people from all walks of life can tune in and they just

01:09:40.917 --> 01:09:50.237
yeah I have it's a somebody needs to do some research in terms of introversion on that one because I don't feel any of my introvert

01:09:50.153 --> 01:09:51.200
um

01:09:51.611 --> 01:10:01.337
Like triggers happening because nobody can see is just audio and nobody is offended if you're just sitting there,

01:10:01.424 --> 01:10:06.873
quietly just listening so you can you can participate whenever you want or not

01:10:06.807 --> 01:10:19.990
yeah it's like the ultimate social Freedom yeah you can listen as much as you'd like you can participate if you want but you don't have to it's no big deal yeah nobody can like if I'm actually a physical party somebody's going to look at me right if you like why

01:10:19.969 --> 01:10:28.155
you know they'll be that pressure to speak but you don't have to in that kind of audio setting and there's that intimacy like you can,

01:10:28.287 --> 01:10:33.115
when it's Audio Only feels like you can reveal a lot more of yourself in some kind of.

01:10:33.742 --> 01:10:46.411
Honest way I don't know what that is what is that a but I was I don't know but I assume it's tapping into something really ancient like we used to tell stories around the fire like our whole storytelling tradition was oral,

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:51.597
originally maybe that but we used visual stuff like

01:10:51.549 --> 01:11:00.292
that's so you can actually see the person I seems like he seems like the visual elements so fundamental to the social interaction but there is,

01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:12.220
something Primal about audio I wonder what that is in still that's why I mean most people listen to podcast I think Audio Only they have it in their ears while they're doing stuff yeah that's how I do it

01:11:12.083 --> 01:11:15.641
and then there's that's how I judge and that's what that's where the friendship.

01:11:16.386 --> 01:11:23.339
Like is formed it's weird that deep connection with other humans is formed because they're in your ear.

01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:35.717
And you get to see them grow you get to see them be bored experience excitement and anger and fear and all those kinds of things it's fascinating it's fascinating.

01:11:35.903 --> 01:11:41.577
The world of podcasting is fascinating because we're we're in this world of essentially radio.

01:11:42.366 --> 01:11:52.181
Even though we all have all this high-definition content all this like Tick-Tock style fast stuff and still I know and we still choose to do this,

01:11:52.332 --> 01:11:56.197
so we're at the end of the day I think that's really what people want most is.

01:11:56.374 --> 01:12:04.848
To talk to each other and to know what people really think and podcasting of all the media that I've ever seen is the one where people come closest to telling you the truth.

01:12:08.734 --> 01:12:20.197
The good and the bad and the bitter and the sweet and all of it but she long-form there's not enough time yeah exactly I had to explain this to people like you talk to CEOs and stuff they don't understand,

01:12:20.293 --> 01:12:24.986
they understand they're starting to understand much better now I as a hard requirement.

01:12:25.523 --> 01:12:34.709
With axios and stuff is that has to be three hours I say like this WOW because there's something they can't

01:12:34.508 --> 01:12:48.833
beam doing marketing stuff for three hours the break I start being human to start relaxing and if they can't that also tells the kind of story but I do that kind of torture for CEOs only anyway yeah when I was there.

01:12:49.163 --> 01:12:55.521
Getting my Publishing House did media training with me before a Bittersweet came out and.

01:12:55.996 --> 01:13:07.944
And they were preparing me for like the five to seven-minute interview that you might have you know if you go on some quick TV thing or something like that and God I hate that it's like it feels like there.

01:13:08.842 --> 01:13:23.833
You're basically having to not tell the full truth somehow because you can't you can't tell it in such a short amount of time well the other thing it's me podcasting was just the best thing that's ever happened the other downside of the 7 Minute interview.

01:13:24.128 --> 01:13:28.740
Is I think you could do a really good job with that but the the dance partner has to be very good

01:13:28.719 --> 01:13:41.298
it's actually challenging for everybody involved it's much harder for everybody involved hmm because you if you can do you know I can imagine like a Christopher Hitchens type character who's just super witty.

01:13:42.088 --> 01:13:54.316
Did then that you could do a seven-minute thing you can get to the core a Bittersweet you can get to the core of the book without asking those generic Small Talk questions because too many people in that short form interview.

01:13:54.853 --> 01:14:08.089
I just asking very generic questions they're doing small talk for so yes yes I all right you only get seven minutes you only get one interesting question go ask the weirdest the the deepest question that.

01:14:09.175 --> 01:14:20.008
That also energizes the other person it's an art form that people don't take seriously I think the 7-minute thing five minute or even less,

01:14:20.023 --> 01:14:22.231
and then the commercials which I

01:14:22.067 --> 01:14:40.776
yeah and I've noticed that many of these roulette with best podcasters or ones where when you're on my side of the table you feel like it's more of a conversation and less like an interview or you're answering all the same questions you've asked you've answered a million times before it's really interesting how different

01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:45.061
experiences and you're right though I do audio thing.

01:14:45.716 --> 01:14:56.512
If you can lose yourself in that the intimacy of that and you don't even remember what stupid stuff you said it's people I've seen that I mean people don't give them enough credit as,

01:14:56.554 --> 01:15:06.261
even in you might not be aware might not be a fan but Joe Rogan is a incredible conversationalist and that he makes you forget.

01:15:07.141 --> 01:15:17.982
That anything is being recorded the year talking at all makes you forget time and you just enjoy yourself and that's whatever that is.

01:15:19.096 --> 01:15:30.144
And that plugs then you plug into that Primal connection to other humans
what's your favorite Leonard Cohen song famous blue raincoat do you know that one,

01:15:30.313 --> 01:15:38.436
maybe I'll play it yeah for people who don't know what word Cohen and this is your first introduction to him it's going to sound so gloomy.

01:15:39.018 --> 01:15:43.909
It's so good he's got this deep rich voice,

01:15:44.059 --> 01:15:58.844
Tori Amos covering famous blue raincoat yeah no we want what the original just like Hallelujah Jeff Buckley covered Leonard Cohen that was a really good one that was a really good one yeah and I also really like Rufus Wainwright it's cover

01:15:58.733 --> 01:16:07.261
but famous blue raincoat for people who don't know it it's basically about a love triangle and it's told from the perspective.

01:16:07.573 --> 01:16:14.003
Have a man whose wife has just been with another guy who is also his friend.

01:16:14.478 --> 01:16:23.366
And he's writing a letter to that other guy and he's reflecting on the way that other relationships have changed in in the wake of this.

01:16:24.227 --> 01:16:31.009
With the Vance and they're still friends so they're still well he refers to him as my brother my killer.

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:37.112
Which is such a Leonard Cohen thing to do because it's always like you know it's light and it's dark all at once.

01:16:39.531 --> 01:16:42.144
Nothing is ever all one thing.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:17:14.320
Music.

01:17:14.163 --> 01:17:21.853
And the fact that it's four in the morning and at the end of December like those are transitional moment you know it's not going in today.

01:17:22.724 --> 01:17:29.712
And it's just a going into the new year the it's not an accident.

01:17:30.763 --> 01:17:37.121
There's something about December this whatever this certain scenes you can paint in your mind.

01:17:37.893 --> 01:17:41.380
There's a there's a poem by Charles Bukowski called Nirvana,

01:17:41.530 --> 01:17:52.219
it's a young man traveling to the middle of nowhere in the snow there's something about the snow isn't the rain or the snow can put you in a certain kind of mood that just,

01:17:52.297 --> 01:17:58.349
what is it James Joyce the Dead the snow is falling and Dublin.

01:17:58.634 --> 01:18:02.346
Put you in a place I mean David yadin who's

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:12.113
he's a researcher and psychedelics and Consciousness at Johns Hopkins he's a great guy and he's done research that has found that when people are

01:18:11.994 --> 01:18:17.974
in their transitional moments of life you know and it could be a career change it could be a divorce it could be.

01:18:18.241 --> 01:18:28.030
They're nearing the end of their life that they very often will say those are their most meaningful moments and their most spiritual moments and so I feel like that's what,

01:18:28.117 --> 01:18:34.196
letter code knows how to tap into instinctively the year after he died his son Adam Cohen

01:18:34.058 --> 01:18:42.424
made a memorial concert for him where all these famous musicians came to Montreal where they had lived and performed his music

01:18:42.277 --> 01:18:52.597
and my husband who's not a Leonard Cohen fan and he's not a Bittersweet type at all but he knows how I feel about him is like you know you should really go to that concert and I felt so,

01:18:52.675 --> 01:19:04.786
ridiculous the whole family went all the way to Montreal I demand a on a Monday and Monday it was just like a random Monday and we got in the plane looks like everyone's out of school

01:19:04.756 --> 01:19:08.279
just so I can go go to this concert and.

01:19:08.816 --> 01:19:18.649
And I got there and at the beginning I was feeling like this was all a terrible mistake because it's all these other musicians

01:19:18.574 --> 01:19:25.374
playing this music and I don't actually really want to hear them like I'd rather listen to him on YouTube yeah and then.

01:19:25.866 --> 01:19:33.989
And then a musician named Damien Rice came and played famous blue raincoat and he sang it and he,

01:19:34.058 --> 01:19:41.803
did the most amazing thing at the end the whole thing was amazing but then at the end he sang this musical riff that was like.

01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:48.717
All I could say is it was like a musical lamentation of the ages and the whole audience

01:19:48.642 --> 01:19:59.033
just Rose silently to its feet and it was one of the greatest moments then I've ever had there's sometimes certain artists in a cover can capture,

01:19:59.148 --> 01:20:08.846
is some kind of deeper way like carrying the thread of the power of the song So been listening a lot to Johnny Cash Hurt

01:20:08.636 --> 01:20:16.939
is a Nine Inch Nails Trent Reznor so you talked about it and your podcast with Rick Rubin yeah was when I reached out to you because I like I love that

01:20:16.873 --> 01:20:30.199
interview and I love that song also yeah yeah yeah so there's that there's the Kennedy Center Honors where they they celebrate a certain artist that did that for Led Zeppelin and I forgot her name is but the lead singer of Heart

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:37.131
perform Stairway to Heaven and it's like if you like alright you take,

01:20:37.191 --> 01:20:42.703
one of the great sort of rock songs of all time what do you do in front of the oh the cool thing is,

01:20:42.872 --> 01:20:57.503
you get to perform this in front of the artist while they're still there you know they're still alive so you get to watch you sort of perform and in that case the president President Obama is there and she's just knocked it out of the park but at the same time without.

01:20:58.311 --> 01:21:00.429
I'll doing.

01:21:01.164 --> 01:21:15.111
The original some hi you're just making it your own you making your own right it's not but not overlapping it really nothing partying from this the spirit of the original it's tough because the original Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen.

01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:24.131
It's just not it's it's so powerful but it's just not as good as some of these covers well I think.

01:21:24.561 --> 01:21:34.530
I think it's the words in the melody and then the covers take it to a different place the thing that Leonard Cohen seems to do well he I don't think he did it on,

01:21:34.644 --> 01:21:41.335
Hallelujah because he was almost being playful on all of it like I don't know,

01:21:41.377 --> 01:21:53.092
as opposed to that deep Melancholy like painful longing thing that Jeff Buckley did and others do too I wonder if it's because in a way he.

01:21:53.476 --> 01:22:04.606
Hey that he over edited it but he apparently worked on that song for years and well if you gazillions of versus and checked most of them out so I wonder if we're hearing his version after.

01:22:04.864 --> 01:22:09.971
He's like a little tired with that process yeah well that's the thing is like

01:22:09.879 --> 01:22:21.287
maybe for my book tour you know is like you get tired of saying the same thing over and over and over and over you forget if you get the I forgot like the initial look the heart of it,

01:22:21.356 --> 01:22:23.051
Yeah but I,

01:22:23.193 --> 01:22:31.883
actually I got a chance to hang out with Dan Reynolds who's the lead singer of Imagine Dragons this is,

01:22:31.961 --> 01:22:42.181
incredible band Super Pop yeah the most-played ban on like Spotify or something that's right it's not really huge Imagine Dragons face so we were listening to their music a lot,

01:22:42.296 --> 01:22:46.935
it is so surreal to be hanging out with them and he's such a daughter such a like

01:22:46.923 --> 01:23:00.015
very few people I met in my life are just as good of a human being and that has to do with the fact that he's struggling struggles he still I think struggles but he struggled for a long time with depression and so out of that pain

01:23:00.012 --> 01:23:08.036
you see born this is really good human being this really good relationship with his wife like that.

01:23:09.095 --> 01:23:18.883
When times are good they Lea and each other for like they did their deeply grateful for those precious moments so it's beautiful to watch but the he said that.

01:23:19.970 --> 01:23:25.041
It's really important to feel the song every time.

01:23:25.678 --> 01:23:31.316
Otherwise people know people are really good at detecting your bullshit you can't fake it,

01:23:31.412 --> 01:23:42.604
yeah you really have to feel it every time you have to feel the emotion of It Whatever the emotion is of the original time you wrote it yeah it's just interesting because it.

01:23:43.079 --> 01:23:45.035
I thought you could maybe fake it.

01:23:46.005 --> 01:23:57.683
But he says he believes person is because he played in front of the gigantic crowds and over and over and over and over and over it's like no every time you have to have to be there there's got to be times when he's about to go out

01:23:57.510 --> 01:24:05.120
and he's not feeling it and he has to figure out some way of getting himself into that her space that's what he's saying you have to otherwise you're just,

01:24:05.135 --> 01:24:10.116
that's the job right don't take the job then.

01:24:10.446 --> 01:24:17.120
And he loves it he says the biggest struggle in fact is the come down from that which is like.

01:24:17.738 --> 01:24:30.056
You have this such a beautiful experience of connected with this large number of people sharing a song that you love and then it's such a rush of connection and then you have to.

01:24:30.503 --> 01:24:47.709
You know when you get off stage you're now back to normal life and that's why a lot of musicians get into heavy drugs and all that kind of stuff because you're looking for that Rush again this very tough to the then go into this speaking of introvert because he probably is an introvert as

01:24:47.544 --> 01:24:48.474
is like,

01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:58.440
you have to find that calmness and how do you find the calmness when you were just playing in front of tens of thousands of people a hundred thousand whatever that number is

01:24:58.266 --> 01:25:01.491
that Rush of connect and everybody is love in the air

01:25:01.381 --> 01:25:11.772
and you still have to find that like inner peace and calm that's interesting because I so I don't know if this is the introvert in me talking and the writer in me talking but.

01:25:12.066 --> 01:25:20.829
I don't know like I love most the moments where let's say I'll get a letter from a reader who will tell me what something I wrote meant to them.

01:25:21.015 --> 01:25:31.964
And they'll talk about having had that kind of moment of you know the communion between the writer and the reader and obviously I wasn't there physically when it happened so I wasn't getting that kind of Rush that a musician would get in a concert.

01:25:33.177 --> 01:25:39.166
Just the knowledge of that having happened out there in the world due to something that I added to it.

01:25:39.451 --> 01:25:49.249
Yeah it's the most amazing love it but see imagine yeah imagine reading like thousands of those letters and then it's such a strong rush and everything else doesn't,

01:25:49.291 --> 01:25:59.178
it could be overwhelming I guess this is but like anything else you have to come down and find a calm place like for example the danger.

01:25:59.986 --> 01:26:06.992
People getting letters like that you start taking yourself too seriously you think like you are a special person somehow but,

01:26:06.998 --> 01:26:17.948
that's you really want to avoid that feeling too yeah I don't actually experience it as that much different from when I'm on the other side of it like if I'm the reader and,

01:26:18.062 --> 01:26:29.101
some other writer has made me feel that way to me it's the same thing yeah me too yeah it's a it's a cool it's a virtual hug I think it's like I was just listening to something about.

01:26:29.513 --> 01:26:32.370
The different Russian writers.

01:26:32.655 --> 01:26:41.650
I was mentioning him to you this academic his name is Gary saw Morrison and he studies Russian literature and he was talking about.

01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:49.653
Don't know if I'll be able to get this right but basically that the people misunderstand a work like Anna Karenina and that we think of it as.

01:26:50.146 --> 01:26:55.830
Telling us that you're supposed to live you're supposed to have like.

01:26:56.169 --> 01:27:09.306
Grand tempestuous romances that might end in death or just bear whatever it is but you know you should be in it for the intensity of the emotion and he's saying actually that's not.

01:27:09.483 --> 01:27:14.185
But exactly not what Tolstoy was saying that

01:27:14.065 --> 01:27:27.887
actually it was the opposite that he was really making he was really advocating for everyday life he was saying it scenes from everyday like he was juxtaposing Anna Karenina with all these other couples who were just living happily and quietly day by day.

01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:36.510
And that was what he believed was the ideal so as opposed to the ground rush and as opposed to the,

01:27:36.643 --> 01:27:43.883
intensity owner if he is there a depth to the is there a romance that just the day-to-day

01:27:43.674 --> 01:27:57.009
this is the romance to the day-to-day and don't get lately don't get distracted by the dopamine roller coaster ride of the grant romantic Notions yeah and it enjoy it while it's happening because those are life experiences also but

01:27:56.997 --> 01:28:00.817
not to mistake those for being everything where is he from.

01:28:01.003 --> 01:28:08.000
He's a professor at Northwestern and Northwestern and apparently his lectures are like the most popular on campus well.

01:28:08.547 --> 01:28:20.640
People love them Gary saw Morrison is an American literary critic a slob pissed he's particularly known for scholarly work on the great Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy and fyodor Dostoevsky

01:28:20.385 --> 01:28:24.402
Morrison is Lawrence T professor in arts and humanities at Northwestern University.

01:28:24.688 --> 01:28:38.878
Wow and there's a lot of incredible work and then I'm sure looking through the lens of Russian literature and the romance of all of that he's looking at modern at the modern world yeah I think you should have him on your podcast and quiet flows the vodka or when Pushkin.

01:28:39.155 --> 01:28:40.436
Comes to shove,

01:28:40.595 --> 01:28:50.608
the curmudgeons guide to Russian literature and culture this is a quote one of the silly books he has on the list okay cool what are you saying I'm sorry oh no I was just saying yeah.

01:28:51.398 --> 01:28:53.156
I find that when I take

01:28:53.117 --> 01:29:06.749
photos on my phone I hardly ever take photos at the moment you're supposed to like everybody's gathered for some event I'll forget to take the photo but I take a lot of like scenes from everyday life because that's what I actually want to remember in the end.

01:29:07.071 --> 01:29:12.934
Yeah yeah I'm the same the same it's actually concerning.

01:29:13.318 --> 01:29:28.157
Because it's bad for productivity because I love everyday life so much then why why do any ambitious big thing your productivity is pretty good I don't know that you have to worry about it and I do so I want to launch a business.

01:29:28.496 --> 01:29:33.072
You know I have a dream outside this is like a fun side thing.

01:29:33.267 --> 01:29:43.073
You know I want to there's been a lifelong passion anyway that's a like building I like building stuff and I haven't been doing that as much as I would like that's.

01:29:43.359 --> 01:29:56.730
Because largely because I like sitting in silence and enjoying the beauty that is just nature and life and when there's people there's people I love people I love everything and so when you love everything.

01:29:56.898 --> 01:29:59.493
Why go through hell to build a company.

01:30:00.787 --> 01:30:11.899
Yeah it's a valid question I mean I think you have to really good reason for wanting to do it but then your heart calls you for the certain sometimes you look out into the mountains and you say,

01:30:11.905 --> 01:30:22.701
for some reason I long to go there even if it means leaving the tribe and putting yourself in danger and doing stupid shit that's the human imperative for exploration

01:30:22.645 --> 01:30:25.897
yeah absolutely like when we were talking about.

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:33.027
You know this idea of longing being like the source code of humanity I think that's also the source code of our creativity.

01:30:33.411 --> 01:30:38.851
It's the same longing for Eden it's like you're always reaching for something,

01:30:39.011 --> 01:30:46.341
that you want to get to or that you want to build yeah it's the best of us what do you think.

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:49.465
You read about creativity and sadness.

01:30:49.913 --> 01:30:58.756
You practically speaking how should we leverage sadness for creativity this is that

01:30:58.726 --> 01:31:04.985
sort of in the artist domain in the writer's domain in the engineering domains and so on it's

01:31:04.937 --> 01:31:14.906
definitely in those domains but it's in all domains you know we're all going to face pain in this life at some point and we all have the ability to.

01:31:16.109 --> 01:31:18.803
Whether it was dance with standard and.

01:31:19.206 --> 01:31:28.472
Live with it for a bit and then try to transform it into something that we find beautiful you know and it's very easy to.

01:31:30.297 --> 01:31:42.948
Didn't notice the Grandeur of like the you know the painting hanging on the gallery wall or the new company that's just been created but it takes a thousand different forms right you know you could bake a cake or like.

01:31:43.494 --> 01:31:56.676
In the wake of the pandemic we've had more people applying to medical school and nursing school and after 9/11 you had people applying for jobs as firefighters and teachers so there's something in the human spirit that.

01:31:56.997 --> 01:32:03.292
Takes pain and turns it into meaning when we're at our best and when we're not at our best we.

01:32:03.497 --> 01:32:09.369
Deny the pain and then take it out on ourselves and on other people so there's a kind of fork in the road what to do with it.

01:32:09.871 --> 01:32:17.688
But we know I mean there's all these studies that I go through in the book like there is one where.

01:32:17.973 --> 01:32:30.669
The researchers had people watch different movies like happy movies sad movies Bittersweet movies and they found when people watch Father of the Bride just like the ultimate Bittersweet you know you're walking

01:32:30.657 --> 01:32:34.512
your daughter down the aisle kind of feeling that was.

01:32:34.897 --> 01:32:42.452
They would give them creativity tasks after watching these different movies and the people who had been primed for bittersweetness were the most creative,

01:32:42.612 --> 01:32:52.265
they were like primed to remember finality you know like love and finality basically love and impermanence there's something about that that's.

01:32:52.586 --> 01:32:55.218
That gets us to our most beautiful state

01:32:55.197 --> 01:33:05.589
I wonder if it is I mean there's studies like that there's a if you looked into the terror management Theory yeah that's really interesting stuff so they especially intensely

01:33:05.496 --> 01:33:14.473
have you focused on that just sad but traumatic like death Prime you would death and see how that changes your mind

01:33:14.426 --> 01:33:16.733
the Hut like both like,

01:33:16.794 --> 01:33:24.826
I don't I don't know if this creativity studies but they have interesting I think a little bit tainted by

01:33:24.815 --> 01:33:33.100
political bias but maybe not mean psychology is a complicated field but they study like Cory likely to vote for right

01:33:32.917 --> 01:33:48.367
if you're primed by existential like by thinking about the fear of mortality feel mortality I forget what the conclusions are but I think they find that people become more tribalistic yeah you know like there is one study where they found that after they primed people that way that,

01:33:48.410 --> 01:33:53.300
that they would get then give them the chance to put.

01:33:53.505 --> 01:34:08.334
Hot sauce and meal that their political opponents were going to be eating and they put way too much hot sauce after they've been primed to worry about death I think at the core we're simple creatures so I actually like

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:17.462
in the book I spent a bunch of time with people who are working on radical life extension you know the quest to live forever

01:34:17.361 --> 01:34:27.941
and people ask them a lot questions like you know the kinds of questions you were talking about earlier well like how are you going to feed everybody and how is there going to be space for everybody if everyone really could live forever,

01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:34.738
and what about conflict when we haven't intensified conflict and their answer to that is.

01:34:35.311 --> 01:34:38.420
They point to Terror management Theory you know and they say.

01:34:38.633 --> 01:34:52.121
Because it's the fear of death they're basically saying it's the fear of death that are causing our conflicts in the first place and that if we remove the fear of death we'd have less conflict to contend with and that I don't really buy that,

01:34:52.245 --> 01:35:05.570
it's possible that that's true but are you also how does the expression go throwing out the baby with the bathwater I are you also going to remove basically any source of meaning and

01:35:05.514 --> 01:35:07.938
happiness in The Human Condition.

01:35:08.269 --> 01:35:22.441
It's very possible that death is fundamental to The Human Condition the fun finality yeah that's the great philosophical question and I went to a conference of people who are working on this and I thought,

01:35:22.546 --> 01:35:28.733
that they were going to be talking about those questions all through the conference but the mo is much more like.

01:35:28.929 --> 01:35:38.240
We're so happy that we're here with people who have gotten past all those quibbles yeah you know we just know there's going to be meeting no matter what the basic assumption is,

01:35:38.354 --> 01:35:49.916
let's try to extend life indefinitely and then we'll figure out if that's a good decision or more like we're sure it's a good decision or earlier at least makes that was what I felt

01:35:49.778 --> 01:35:53.940
it's it's it's either with that they sure it's either we're sure.

01:35:54.486 --> 01:36:03.690
It's a good decision or we're sure that is good to believe that it's a good decision meaning like there's no downside to

01:36:03.588 --> 01:36:12.836
to that even if we find out it's wrong but yes there's a kind of certainty obviously you want to extend human life that's the kind of assumption that always seemed.

01:36:13.103 --> 01:36:17.210
Now it could be true.

01:36:17.667 --> 01:36:25.060
But just like the people who over focus on colonizing other planets.

01:36:26.003 --> 01:36:28.797
It feels like you neglect the beauty.

01:36:29.073 --> 01:36:41.742
And the the struggle of our life here on Earth I've sort of the same kind of criticism whether it's thinking about Valhalla or any other afterlife is you have if you're not careful.

01:36:42.648 --> 01:36:46.801
Forget to make this life a great one

01:36:46.735 --> 01:36:58.693
whatever happens afterwards so yeah definitely but from the engineering from a biology from a chemistry perspective is very interesting to think how do we extend this thing because it does seem that nature

01:36:58.681 --> 01:37:01.610
the way designed living organisms.

01:37:01.949 --> 01:37:11.602
It really wants us to die because that's part of the selection mechanism that's part of this seems to be fundamental to Evolution it.

01:37:12.518 --> 01:37:13.205
The kiss,

01:37:13.355 --> 01:37:25.349
people young then use protection was the one third young brain they get to explore a lot of get to figure out the world that come up their own novel ideas how to adapt a how to respond to that world

01:37:25.301 --> 01:37:35.369
and then as you get older and older they get like stubborn and stuck in their ways and so we need them to die so we make room for new

01:37:35.321 --> 01:37:40.275
life that's able to adapt to the changing environment if the old doesn't die.

01:37:40.668 --> 01:37:46.900
Then you're not going to get stale and not be adaptable to the changing environment,

01:37:46.916 --> 01:38:01.340
maybe it doesn't have to happen soon yeah maybe he doesn't think pressing listen I'm a big fan of pressing snooze and the alarm clock and the same way I do I'm one of the people that believe it's.

01:38:02.363 --> 01:38:09.874
Or I don't definitely believe course I don't know but I think death is a.

01:38:11.591 --> 01:38:21.352
Is a fundamental part of life but yeah if I'm on my deathbed I would sure as hell Press News as many times as possible yeah I know this interesting because I,

01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:31.156
in some ways I really I share your instinct there is one scientist who I spoke to it that conference he's one of the leading Advocates and he said,

01:38:31.315 --> 01:38:40.095
you know that's a story that we've invented for ourselves because we have no choice and if you really believe that you have no choice then your.

01:38:40.317 --> 01:38:48.755
Then it's adaptive to tell that story that death gives meaning to life good point but if you really think you don't if you really think you could triumph over it,

01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:50.736
would you still be telling that same story,

01:38:50.850 --> 01:39:02.376
and I've been thinking about that question ever since
yeah ya know they got a good point they got a good point no matter what as an engineering and the scientific Pursuits it's a beautiful one

01:39:02.211 --> 01:39:11.180
in your personal life if we can go there sure what's up been some Dark Places you've got in your own mind

01:39:11.123 --> 01:39:18.723
grief loss
sad moments moments of sadness.

01:39:19.198 --> 01:39:21.622
That have made you a better writer.

01:39:22.538 --> 01:39:32.371
Better Creator a better human being well
I mean I've been through a lot of bereavement just in these last couple of years with covid but.

01:39:33.214 --> 01:39:35.440
Even before that.

01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:49.998
I mean there's there's all kinds of stuff I write about in the book and in some ways I feel like I can write about things those kinds of things better than I can speak them but I had a really complicated relationship with my mother growing up where.

01:39:50.886 --> 01:40:01.016
We had a kind of Garden of Eden during my childhood like we were intensely intensely close and and my mother because of.

01:40:02.931 --> 01:40:08.164
Some vulnerabilities that she had reacted.

01:40:08.350 --> 01:40:22.711
With a lot of trouble to my adolescence and to Growing independent from her and starting to have different religious views and different political views and all kinds of things and.

01:40:24.248 --> 01:40:34.090
And we had a pretty intense break that I described in the book and and it was so intense that even though after that we.

01:40:34.322 --> 01:40:49.043
Still would get together for holidays and talk to each other on the phone and all that there was a sense in which like it was over at that point the relationship was Over the Garden of Eden was no more yeah yeah it was like a feeling of like.

01:40:49.527 --> 01:40:56.290
Yeah like I know what Eden was like and and it's not there anymore.

01:40:56.458 --> 01:41:01.259
And I think it was all the more confusing because like if you lose someone to actual bereavement.

01:41:01.572 --> 01:41:09.100
You go through a mourning process and people have thought for thousands of years about how to do that but with something like this,

01:41:09.152 --> 01:41:17.887
there's no process because you're not even admitting to yourself especially when you're like in your teens and 20s that your morning something so.

01:41:18.433 --> 01:41:24.386
But but it was the case that for decades for decades I could not

01:41:24.284 --> 01:41:38.861
answer even the simplest question about my mother like where did she grow up without tears in my eyes or more than tears in my eyes like embarrassing embarrassing tears so I would just try to steer the subject in another place

01:41:38.724 --> 01:41:43.741
but I will say you know two things happened when is that I've spent

01:41:43.684 --> 01:41:51.041
the last 67 years writing this book about joy and sorrow and loss and love and all of it.

01:41:51.372 --> 01:41:59.774
And I've really come to terms with all of it and then the second thing that happened is my mother now has Alzheimer's and.

01:42:00.753 --> 01:42:02.762
In her Alzheimer's.

01:42:03.048 --> 01:42:13.142
She still actually the same person like she's forgotten most things but she still has these conversational lanes that you can travel down that are like the way she always was and.

01:42:13.905 --> 01:42:25.206
The way that she was when I was a kid which was like so incredibly loving and so connected and so warm and sweet and funny and all of it all the things I remembered.

01:42:25.617 --> 01:42:30.769
Like it's all come back and for all these decades.

01:42:31.774 --> 01:42:45.128
I had been wondering whether that Garden of Eden I remembered had actually happened or whether you know that was just like the fantasy of a child and you know maybe it was always difficult and I had not seen it but.

01:42:45.773 --> 01:42:55.777
I'm seeing her now and I realized that it was all true everything I remember it was all true it all happened because it's happening again.

01:42:56.044 --> 01:43:05.878
And you return to the Garden of Eden for time yeah and to Childhood it's always a question of whether you can return to that place.

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:11.180
Well I don't know I don't even know if I'd say I've returned because I'm a different person now and I don't,

01:43:11.294 --> 01:43:16.978
are you need her and you sure are you sure you're still a different than the

01:43:16.867 --> 01:43:27.123
the then the ten-year-old well okay feel different no I mean I'm the same person in terms of my need for love and love of love and all of that but

01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:28.500
I don't look.

01:43:29.884 --> 01:43:42.823
I'm not dependent on my mother for it the way I was then and that makes the experience really different yeah they're younger she's a she's a god figure what is that that the roots the parents.

01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:48.819
Such a funny civilization will live and there's a depth of connection to parents that's.

01:43:49.293 --> 01:43:57.056
That's probably more powerful than anything else in terms of its formative effect on who you are I think it's the most powerful and in fact.

01:43:58.268 --> 01:44:09.497
When this started happening I got to college and I took a class in creative writing and I tried to write a story a fictional story a fictionalized version of what was happening and I called it the most passionate love.

01:44:10.115 --> 01:44:25.107
Because of what you just said yeah and the teacher actually said to me she's like you should put this story in a drawer and not take it out again for 30 years because you're way too close to it yeah so I've now finally written it 30 years later.

01:44:25.338 --> 01:44:34.073
Yeah you probably still too close to it though I don't know though I mean.

01:44:34.601 --> 01:44:35.630
I do think like,

01:44:35.664 --> 01:44:47.558
I think everybody goes through experiences in this life where you're experiencing like a fundamental pain of separation and desire for a union and it takes so many different forms,

01:44:47.592 --> 01:44:58.019
and this was my Primal form of it but you know for someone else it's a betrayal or a bereavement or an exile from a country of their birth or whatever it is,

01:44:58.169 --> 01:45:09.803
but then you get to solve that puzzle for for the for the rest of your life yeah active like I really do believe that you know that the original love that.

01:45:10.115 --> 01:45:14.466
We long for like that one of the great things that you learn as you grow older is that though.

01:45:15.057 --> 01:45:25.197
That the love exists in some plane that's more General than the particularized form in which you first knew it yeah I mean that's why despite all the creepy interpretations with.

01:45:25.662 --> 01:45:33.181
But even though Sigmund Freud is probably wrong in the details he was the first one to sort of suggest that

01:45:33.143 --> 01:45:36.567
our experiences give me he said that,

01:45:36.609 --> 01:45:51.114
that was really controversial at the time when young people they start having sexual thoughts I could gauge to or something whatever the hell he said so you develop this kind of connection to do the opposite sex or whatever did your mother to your parents.

01:45:52.426 --> 01:45:58.388
And I think a lot of that is shown to be probably not true what is,

01:45:58.529 --> 01:46:10.775
like a deeper truth there's your first early experiences of Love or depth of connection and probably some how strongly formative of your conception of love and your definition.

01:46:11.403 --> 01:46:19.130
Of the perfect thing you're reaching for for the rest of your life yeah I think that's right and you can really see it when you become a parent too.

01:46:19.397 --> 01:46:32.011
You know you can just see things like there's those screwed up you know I have to say it like I mean knock on wood I actually feel like like we're doing pretty well like my kids are teenagers now and.

01:46:32.630 --> 01:46:41.032
I really had thought that I wasn't going to repeat the issues that I had been through with my mom and I can say I really am not.

01:46:41.470 --> 01:46:48.882
Yeah like my mom for various reasons just had a lot of trouble with my Independence and I just don't feel that at all.

01:46:49.113 --> 01:46:54.670
So yeah they might there might be other things you're totally blind too,

01:46:54.776 --> 01:47:07.201
I guess that's possible is that the way of parenting is you solve the problems of the past but there's that matter anyone he did ride find out and enter 20 years but like so far so good what was them

01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:11.487
but parenting can you keep can you give from your own experience and from your writing.

01:47:11.844 --> 01:47:21.416
Yeah well oh my God there's a lot to say so on the Bittersweet side of things the wisdom that I would give is.

01:47:22.539 --> 01:47:32.344
That
especially for kids who are growing up in relative comfort with everything going pretty well,

01:47:32.486 --> 01:47:35.171
they get the idea that.

01:47:35.898 --> 01:47:49.638
Real life is when things are going well and when things don't go well it's like a detour from the main road as opposed to understanding that it's all the main road and I tell the story in the book of.

01:47:50.131 --> 01:47:56.120
This time that we went on the family vacation where we rented a house in the countryside and.

01:47:56.612 --> 01:48:05.716
The house was next to this field where we're lived two donkeys that our kids fell in love with they were like really little at the time two boys and.

01:48:06.065 --> 01:48:20.183
They're spending all this time feeding carrots to the donkeys and it's all beautiful and then comes the day where they realize that we're leaving in like two days and they're never going to see these donkeys again and they start crying themselves to sleep and the usual things that.

01:48:20.639 --> 01:48:30.356
Parents might say at a moment like that of like you know maybe we'll come back or another family will feed them will feed these donkeys none of that made any difference.

01:48:30.623 --> 01:48:32.633
But when we said to them.

01:48:32.981 --> 01:48:46.488
You know goodbye is part of life and this feeling you're having everybody has it you've had it before you're going to have it again you'll feel better in a couple days,

01:48:46.593 --> 01:48:51.997
but this is the way it's supposed to be this is natural that's when they stopped crying because.

01:48:52.606 --> 01:49:02.260
I think that's when they stopped resisting yeah like it's one thing to feel the pain of goodbye and it's another thing to be feeling like this isn't supposed to be happening.

01:49:02.644 --> 01:49:16.177
If the resistance part of this isn't supposed to be happening that makes life really difficult yeah as I said you're more clear-eyed view of what it really is this isn't he supposed to be happening there's a show called Yellowstone as recently started watching

01:49:16.084 --> 01:49:28.996
yeah I know I've heard of it we actually started watching it but only a few minutes and didn't get into it so there's just a quick it's not a spoiler of any kind but there's a father taking out the Sun for the first time to go hunting and

01:49:28.966 --> 01:49:31.652
you know the shooter first buck and.

01:49:32.927 --> 01:49:39.610
The sun is get really sad because he pulls the trigger and he took a life and the father says that.

01:49:40.075 --> 01:49:48.765
Everybody gets killed in this life that's the way of nature that's the way each one of us is going to get killed and.

01:49:49.267 --> 01:49:57.461
It's interesting because I didn't really think of it that way because you think you died but he really framed it as killed

01:49:57.414 --> 01:50:08.588
hmm because he's like there's no such thing as dying of old age that's medically let's discuss that a bit but basically there's something whether it's.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:15.196
A truck or a bacteria something is going.

01:50:15.616 --> 01:50:23.190
Kill you in the end and that was an interesting way to look at it because we tend to think of humans aren't.

01:50:23.925 --> 01:50:31.562
Are supposed to be killed we think of murder is one of the sins that have one of the things that you don't do in society but you know what,

01:50:31.676 --> 01:50:35.181
we do that the more technical discussion whether we

01:50:34.989 --> 01:50:51.592
ultimate get killed by something in the end but it to some degree that's true at least for most of us that there's something that gets is whether it's cancer those kinds of things it's interesting but yeah it's that reframing of this not it's supposed to be this is the way of the world yeah,

01:50:51.688 --> 01:51:00.558
it's funny I mean you know at the same time that I just wrote a whole book about the fact that this is the way it is like I really do believe this is the way it is and

01:51:00.519 --> 01:51:04.141
and with this reality there's an intense beauty that comes along with it.

01:51:04.643 --> 01:51:11.973
So we have to accept the reality to get to the beauty I believe that and at the same time there's a part of me that's just like.

01:51:12.276 --> 01:51:16.258
Yeah but give me the magic wand make the world different yeah.

01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:31.328
Yeah yeah no I don't know how much of this is a female thing to like I was watching with my son and my 12 year old the other day we were watching this show about the Battle of Thermopylae and yeah and it was like all about you know

01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:41.221
Valor and glory on the battlefield and and I said to him something like gosh don't you just wish we lived in a world where.

01:51:42.227 --> 01:51:44.859
You didn't have to do all this in order for everyone

01:51:44.847 --> 01:51:55.832
just to live their lives just looked at me completely puzzled like no you know like to him it all just seemed self-evident that the world would be structured that way

01:51:55.784 --> 01:52:04.762
and he had like the twelve-year-old like admiration for the dollar of it all but you wonder if that's if that's.

01:52:05.003 --> 01:52:10.911
Nature or nurture
I wonder what that world looks like.

01:52:11.484 --> 01:52:24.919
We do live in a world where murder scene as bad but you look at a lot of the human history I don't know if they had the same kind of conception of that in terms of the you have to ask

01:52:24.781 --> 01:52:32.444
what kind of murder you know for what purpose you know war was a way of life.

01:52:32.685 --> 01:52:39.835
It's interesting it's interesting if we can imagine properly a future that is.

01:52:40.715 --> 01:52:51.835
Different than ours in terms of operating under the different moral systems I'd like saying with living indefinitely Or living in a society with no war.

01:52:52.958 --> 01:52:54.842
Like how fundamental is war.

01:52:55.361 --> 01:53:08.750
How fundamentals death I mean I think it's so fundamental to our source code I just wish that our source code were different basically like I can't get people already have that wish there's there's brain computer interfaces that try to merge.

01:53:09.540 --> 01:53:19.400
So greater and greater with smartphones were already kind of cyborgs but greater and greater merger of computational power so literally,

01:53:19.451 --> 01:53:29.464
adding source code to our original source code just a different there's the mushy biology that runs source code and then there's more cold electrical

01:53:29.372 --> 01:53:33.687
systems and then they integrate together and potentially.

01:53:34.152 --> 01:53:40.411
One day we offload
the magic that is human consciousness

01:53:40.391 --> 01:53:53.834
also into the machine and then we'll get to see maybe maybe they'll be a little bit less asshole issue about the whole War thing that be more but there is I think even when I engine when I think about engineering.

01:53:54.452 --> 01:54:00.910
Human intelligence are superhuman intelligence systems I feel like they also need to have the yin yang of life.

01:54:01.114 --> 01:54:08.769
They have to be able to be afraid and to be sad and all those kinds of things but maybe it's because I'm.

01:54:09.135 --> 01:54:17.474
A product in this particular environment maybe sadness is a human useful human invention but not a universal one,

01:54:17.615 --> 01:54:28.690
this is what I don't know because this is where I come back to the as I told you like the original reason that I wrote my whole book was the feeling that somehow in the expression of sad music.

01:54:28.994 --> 01:54:36.963
Is what other people see when they talk about God like there's something so there's like an ultimate Beauty there.

01:54:37.276 --> 01:54:41.230
Yeah but I don't know if we have access to without that but maybe we do.

01:54:42.011 --> 01:54:50.143
But I can't say in this world it's a great way to get access to that state is it within the reach of science to deeply understand this you think.

01:54:50.626 --> 01:54:58.362
To understand that why he feel sad when you listen to a song for why you feel loved when you're listening to a sad sound to us as all right yeah.

01:54:58.530 --> 01:55:09.408
Why the sad why the sad song opens up some kind of deep connection to something you can call Divine or something whatever the heck that is yeah

01:55:09.396 --> 01:55:22.776
I do think I mean we have like really early signs of it from the research and I'm sure we're just at the yeah scratching the surface stage but I mean like we know for example that you know the vagus nerve which,

01:55:22.873 --> 01:55:26.260
it's so fundamental that governs our breathing and digestion.

01:55:26.780 --> 01:55:33.111
Are vagus nerve also activates when we see another being in distress there's like a,

01:55:33.243 --> 01:55:37.315
instinctive impulse to want to make it stop,

01:55:37.456 --> 01:55:51.737
and the theory is that that's an evolutionary design because we had to be able to respond to the cries of our infants you know and from that ability grows the greater ability to respond to other people's cries too so.

01:55:52.508 --> 01:55:59.056
That's probably just you know
like the very first step in being able to understand what all that is,

01:55:59.197 --> 01:56:06.023
we've already given plenty of advice but broadly what advice would you give to Young Folks,

01:56:06.047 --> 01:56:19.149
today about career about life whether they want to be writers lawyers scientists musicians and artists whatever the heck they want to be how can they live a life that can be proud of

01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:23.110
okay here's what I think.

01:56:23.557 --> 01:56:29.195
He's an absolutely do that thing that you're dying to do.

01:56:29.570 --> 01:56:42.537
But you should always have a plan B and it like a back-up plan and a way of earning a living no matter what happens because funny I feel like people,

01:56:42.687 --> 01:56:54.014
we have this narrative in our culture of like that the Glamorous thing is to figure out the thing you love and then Risk Everything to achieve that but,

01:56:54.138 --> 01:56:59.622
first of all a lot of people aren't comfortable with that level of risk and second when you're living with that level of risk.

01:57:00.412 --> 01:57:08.499
That's a cognitive load too and so you don't have the full emotion and heart to be able to focus on the thing that you actually really love because your.

01:57:08.793 --> 01:57:13.756
Stressed out about it so I'd say like can't the back-up plan in place and then do the thing.

01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:24.478
My advice would be the opposite huh okay I'm I'm leaving like the Romantic well I think the best the the truth is be.

01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:26.962
Aware the cost.

01:57:27.149 --> 01:57:36.838
Not having a plan B has to do it deliberately if you don't but I you know I would be cows can find what you love and let it kill you I think.

01:57:37.276 --> 01:57:41.600
Now you have to actually know your personality I know if I have a plan B.

01:57:42.039 --> 01:57:47.659
I will not try as hard on plan a and I would likely take Plan B.

01:57:47.845 --> 01:57:55.851
Because if plan is is the risky thing hmm I just work way much better one in the state of desperation,

01:57:55.983 --> 01:58:06.113
so with my back against the wall and you have to know that about yourself I think that has to do I think we can refine it to say you actually have to really know yourself and how you respond to different kinds of risk,

01:58:06.129 --> 01:58:10.777
like I would not do well in that kind of situation I'd be like up at two in the morning

01:58:10.666 --> 01:58:19.580
worrying about it yeah we're as if I have something like it doesn't have to be paying the rent in some Grand way but if there's some basic way of paying the rent

01:58:19.506 --> 01:58:26.918
then my heart's create do the thing I really love that's hilarious I for me the only way I'm free is.

01:58:27.194 --> 01:58:34.542
When I don't know how I'm going to be the right huh yeah cuz that's because otherwise I'll,

01:58:34.603 --> 01:58:38.251
find a way to pay the rent that's not at all

01:58:38.213 --> 01:58:47.452
a source of deep fulfillment for me so I stay so it's like if you don't have like the what's the expression I don't know something like the dog at your back yeah

01:58:47.395 --> 01:59:01.658
deadline and you won't actually do it I agree real or artificial deadlines anxiety and so on so yeah you have to if yeah so the advice is know your triggers but yeah but we're still saying that the same basic thing of like,

01:59:01.745 --> 01:59:03.674
do the thing you really love it.

01:59:04.364 --> 01:59:12.055
Fed Up the strategy as the rest of your life early to your personality exactly exactly what do you think is the meaning of life.

01:59:12.475 --> 01:59:17.718
The meaning of this whole thing probably has something to do with.

01:59:19.038 --> 01:59:23.686
Whatever we feel when we listen to us that song yeah.

01:59:24.547 --> 01:59:37.757
Because two things come simultaneously to my mind when you ask that question I've been asking it since I was four I remember the first time I did the question is more important than the answer probably yeah keep asking.

01:59:38.033 --> 01:59:45.175
I don't know the first one is Beauty and I don't know why Beauty so important but I just know that it is impossible to Define perhaps.

01:59:45.523 --> 01:59:52.466
Is it definable yeah
other than you know it when you see it I don't know I mean just.

01:59:54.147 --> 02:00:03.494
Has to do with that line you feel something when you just see it or hear it yeah you just see it and it's like like some it's.

02:00:03.860 --> 02:00:11.497
Whatever can delivery to that mode of transcendence where you're no longer purely in your own self and.

02:00:11.935 --> 02:00:16.790
You're in something higher and when you're in those states of mind.

02:00:17.445 --> 02:00:22.524
You know it because you have the temporary Sensation that.

02:00:22.882 --> 02:00:29.663
That you could die at that moment that the people you love could die and it will all be okay because there's something else.

02:00:30.534 --> 02:00:35.029
So that's my first answer and then the second answer is

02:00:34.972 --> 02:00:46.101
the need to relieve psychic pain I was like other people psychic pain I don't know why that's just that's just like an Impulse that I have psychic pain is more like like suffering of any form.

02:00:46.351 --> 02:00:52.394
Yeah but I mean
what is there a particular yeah just making the world.

02:00:54.021 --> 02:00:56.959
Better and less pain,

02:00:57.001 --> 02:01:10.471
let's paint to go around in general as you're just sort of optimistic desire and longing for a world without sort of Destruction without malevolent destruction,

02:01:10.522 --> 02:01:18.212
yeah we're all very aware that wouldn't be necessary yeah exactly exactly but yeah like I so I had this moment.

02:01:19.110 --> 02:01:25.900
It wasn't so long ago I was doing some interview and somebody asked me like what are you longing for right now and.

02:01:26.168 --> 02:01:35.578
My answer that moment was like you know what I'm actually at this moment in life where I'm not longing for anything I'm at this particular Way Station where everything.

02:01:35.819 --> 02:01:38.513
Is the way I want it to be and.

02:01:39.807 --> 02:01:47.038
Of course the minute you say something like that you know you're going to be proven wrong because like an hour later I get a letter from.

02:01:47.602 --> 02:01:55.797
A reader who have been in touch with over the years and he was telling me about like a state as I kick struggle that he's going through and.

02:01:56.704 --> 02:02:00.541
I just thought oh my gosh if there anything I could do to make it that,

02:02:00.692 --> 02:02:08.121
his life wouldn't have been such that he would be in this position in the first place like his struggles had to do with a long life history.

02:02:09.721 --> 02:02:22.588
So I don't know why I feel that it's funny but I do those moments when you were just at peace there's nothing else you want feel like that's like a temporary Repose like it was exactly

02:02:22.522 --> 02:02:25.522
you could you bet your ass.

02:02:25.835 --> 02:02:37.090
A desire follows that at some point but you get to enjoy those little moments yeah I took me when I say that even when he asked me and I answered that way I said this is a Way Station like I knew it was temporary

02:02:36.962 --> 02:02:43.131
but I didn't realize it would be disrupted like an hour later and said of to give you push back.

02:02:43.381 --> 02:02:50.846
To your to your statement about the possibility of creating because she a beauty.

02:02:51.194 --> 02:03:05.042
And basically alleviating suffering is a quarterly like from Hunter and styles to the pushes back against that which is for every moment of Triumph for every instance of beauty many Souls must be trampled.

02:03:05.679 --> 02:03:08.031
But that's a very Hunter as Thompson

02:03:07.903 --> 02:03:17.772
you know how yeah yeah yeah it's not the greatest philosopher all of all times but he certainly beautiful a chaotic human being

02:03:17.652 --> 02:03:27.495
well that's true and I will tell you that my nickname for my husband is gonzo kind of because of him you know he invented that form of Gonzo journalism where like the.

02:03:27.825 --> 02:03:37.217
The writer is totally in the story and my husband's like that's his personality he's in everything that he does he's really in it he's really,

02:03:37.277 --> 02:03:44.437
he just lived that way so well then there was name is Ken but I call him Gonzo like 90% of the time

02:03:44.281 --> 02:03:52.691
well then it's a beautiful way to end the season this is thank you for your work thank you for being who you are thanking you for initially at least making me

Support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from Susan Cain herself.

02:04:29.616 --> 02:04:41.592
The highly sensitive introvert tends to be philosophical or spiritual and their orientation rather than materialistic or hedonistic they dislike small talk.

02:04:42.093 --> 02:04:50.000
They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive they dream vividly and can often recall their dreams the next day.

02:04:50.439 --> 02:04:54.492
They love music nature art and physical Beauty.

02:04:55.120 --> 02:05:03.117
If you'll accept really strong emotions sometimes acute bouts of Joy but also sorrow Melancholy and fear.

02:05:03.708 --> 02:05:11.173
Highly sensitive people also process information about their environments both physical and emotional unusually deeply.

02:05:11.783 --> 02:05:21.274
They tend to notice so these that others miss another person's shifted mood or a light bulb burning a Touch Too brightly.

02:05:22.478 --> 02:05:25.730
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
