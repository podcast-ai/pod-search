00:00:00.017 --> 00:00:06.982
The following is a conversation with Richard Wolff
one of the top Marxist Economist and philosophers in the world.

00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:17.236
This is a heavy Topic in general and for me personally given my family history in the Soviet Union in Russia and in Ukraine.

00:00:18.025 --> 00:00:28.174
Today the words Marxism socialism and communism are used to attack and to divide much more than to understand and to learn.

00:00:29.287 --> 00:00:32.108
This podcast I seek the ladder.

00:00:32.843 --> 00:00:41.317
I believe we need to study the ideas of Karl Marx as well as their various implementations throughout the 20th and the 21st centuries.

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:47.528
And in general we need to both Steel Man and to consider seriously the ideas we demonize.

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:57.161
And to challenge the ideas with dogmatically except this true even when doing so is unpleasant and at times dangerous.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.750

00:03:54.161 --> 00:04:00.582
And especially if there's going to be frustrating dead ends you know I get excited about an idea

00:04:00.552 --> 00:04:13.023
I start thinking through it I start to get your design and then you realize not at doesn't work for this reason for that reason for this reason and so on and then you have to stay in that failure hold.

00:04:13.362 --> 00:04:24.042
And make sure mentally that you're correct in your valuation backtrack and see can we sneak around the reason that's doesn't work so that that can be really exhausting type of thinking

This is the Luxe Friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's Richard Wolff.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:10.320
Music.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:24.717
Let's start with the basic question but maybe not so basic after all what is Marxism what are the defining characteristics of Marxism as an economic and political Theory and ideology.

00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:31.937
Well the simplest way to begin a definition would be to say it's the tradition that takes its

00:07:31.862 --> 00:07:40.021
founding inspiration from The Works of Karl Marx but because

00:07:39.955 --> 00:07:49.339
these ideas that he put forward spread as fast as they did and as globally as they did,

00:07:49.408 --> 00:07:54.362
literally it's 140 years since Marks died.

00:07:54.755 --> 00:08:03.103
And in that time his ideas have become major types of thinking in every country on the

00:08:03.019 --> 00:08:17.219
Earth if you know much about the great ideas of human history that's an extraordinary spread in an extraordinarily short period of historical time

00:08:17.117 --> 00:08:23.556
and what that has meant that speed of spread and that Geographic diversity

00:08:23.427 --> 00:08:32.351
is that the marxian ideas interacted with very different cultural histories religious histories

00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:34.107
and economic conditions.

00:08:34.446 --> 00:08:48.448
So the end result was that the ideas were interpreted differently in different places at different times and therefore Marxism as a kind of first flush definition is the

00:08:48.409 --> 00:08:57.414
totality of all of these very different ways of coming to terms with it for the,

00:08:57.429 --> 00:09:07.091
roughly 40 50 years Marxism was a tradition of thinking critically about capitalism

00:09:06.971 --> 00:09:19.640
Marx himself that's all he really did he never wrote a book about communism in ever wrote a book really about socialism either his comments were occasional fragmentary dispersed

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.169
what he was really interested in was a critical analysis of capitalism.

00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:33.972
And that's what Marxism was more or less in its first 40 or 50 years the only.

00:09:34.473 --> 00:09:45.414
Qualification of what I just said was something that happened in Paris for a few weeks in 1871 there was a collapse of the French.

00:09:45.708 --> 00:09:56.514
Consequent upon losing a war to bismarck's Germany and in the result was something called the Paris commune the working class of Paris rose up

00:09:56.493 --> 00:10:00.700
basically took over the function of running

00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:15.536
the Parisian economy and the Parisian society and Marxist people people influenced by marks were very active in that Community the leadership of the Communist and Marx wasn't that far away he was in London.

00:10:15.785 --> 00:10:23.241
These things were happening in Paris you know that's an easy transport even then and for a short time.

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:27.446
Very short
Marxism had a different.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:38.464
Quality in addition to being a critique of capitalism it became a theory of how to organize Society differently.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:47.412
Before that had only been implicit now it became explicit what is the leadership of the Paris commune going to do

00:10:47.338 --> 00:10:54.380
and why and in what order in other words governing organizing a society.

00:10:54.575 --> 00:11:09.504
But since it only lasted a few weeks the French army regrouped and under the leadership of people were very opposed to Mark's they March back in the Paris took over killed a large number of the.

00:11:09.663 --> 00:11:19.254
Of the communards as they were called and deported them to islands in the Pacific that the were part of the French Empire at the time.

00:11:19.521 --> 00:11:24.430
The really big change happens in Russia in 1917 that now you have.

00:11:24.634 --> 00:11:29.678
A group of marxist sledding Trotsky all the rest who.

00:11:30.008 --> 00:11:35.224
Or in this bizarre position to seize a.

00:11:35.437 --> 00:11:41.723
Once again a warlike in France this organizes the.

00:11:41.945 --> 00:11:49.420
Throws the government into a very bad reputation because it is the government that losers World War One

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:57.486
has to withdraw as you know brest-litovsk in all of that and the government collapses and the army revolts.

00:11:57.852 --> 00:12:02.860
And in that situation a very small political party.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:11.368
Russian Social Democratic Workers Party splits under the pressures of all of this.

00:12:11.968 --> 00:12:14.644
Into the Bolshevik and menshevik.

00:12:14.939 --> 00:12:25.231
Divisions Lenin Trotsky and the others are in the Bolshevik Division and to make a long story short he's in Exile his position Lenin's position

00:12:25.228 --> 00:12:30.218
makes him gets him deported because he says Russian workers should not be.

00:12:30.729 --> 00:12:39.779
Killing German Workers are be this is a war of capitalist who are dividing the world up into colonies and Russian working people have no.

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:45.108
Should not kill and should not die for such a thing as you can expect.

00:12:45.222 --> 00:12:54.822
They arrest him and they throw him out interestingly in the United States the the comparable leader at that time of the Socialist Party here.

00:12:54.981 --> 00:13:05.696
As you know there was no Communist party at this point that comes later the head of the Socialist Party is very important American figure named Eugene Victor Debs

00:13:05.603 --> 00:13:14.798
makes exactly the same argument to the Americans should not fight in the war he's in the past has nothing to do with Lana I don't even know if they,

00:13:14.858 --> 00:13:21.630
no of each other but he does it on his own he gets arrested and put in jail here in the United States,

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.564
by the way runs for president from jail and does very well.

00:13:25.687 --> 00:13:35.530
Really very well remarkable and he's the inspiration for Bernie Sanders if you you see the link although he had much more,

00:13:35.554 --> 00:13:49.555
courage politically than Bernie has that's the internet I'd love to return to that link maybe later yes history Rhymes yes the complicated story anyway with the importance in terms of Marxism is that now

00:13:49.489 --> 00:13:52.751
this seizure of power.

00:13:52.883 --> 00:14:04.850
By a group of marxists that is a group of people inspired by marks developing what you might call a Russian even though they were differences among the Russians too but

00:14:04.703 --> 00:14:13.240
a Russian interpretation this now has to be transformed from a critique of capitalism

00:14:13.165 --> 00:14:21.099
into a plan at least what are you going to do in the Soviet Union and a lot of this was then trial

00:14:20.988 --> 00:14:25.069
never marks never laid any of this out

00:14:24.967 --> 00:14:33.000
probably wouldn't have been all that relevant if he had because it was 50 years earlier in another country Etc so what

00:14:32.871 --> 00:14:44.379
begins to happen and you can see how this happens and more later in China and Cuba and Vietnam and Korea and so on is that you have kind of a bifurcation.

00:14:44.637 --> 00:14:53.805
Much of Marxism remains chiefly the critique of capitalism but another part of it becomes.

00:14:53.946 --> 00:14:58.531
A set and they differ from one to the other a set of Notions.

00:14:58.645 --> 00:15:12.133
Of what an alternative post-capitalist Society or to look like how it ought to work and there's lots of disagreement about it lots of confusion and I would say that,

00:15:12.157 --> 00:15:19.965
that's still where it is that you have a tradition now that has these two major Wings critique of capitalism,

00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:30.156
notion of the alternative and then a variety of each of those and that would be the framework in which I would answer that's what Marxism is about

00:15:30.144 --> 00:15:35.260
it's basic idea if you had to have one is that Human Society.

00:15:35.725 --> 00:15:41.607
I can do better than capitalism and it ought to try and then we can start to talk about.

00:15:42.018 --> 00:15:54.633
What we mean by capitalism fine so we'll look at the critique of capitalism on one side but maybe stepping back what do you think marks would say if you just looked at the

00:15:54.432 --> 00:16:04.274
different implementations of the ideas of Marxism throughout the 20th century were his ideas that were implicit were made explicit.

00:16:05.244 --> 00:16:14.150
Would would he shake his head would he enjoy some of the parts of the implementations like what how do you think he would analyze it

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:19.101
well he had a great sense of humor I don't know if you had a chance to take a look at his writing but

00:16:19.008 --> 00:16:31.992
he had an extraordinary sense of humors are my guess is he would deploy his humor and answering this question too he would say some of them are inspiring some of his interpretations of his work and he's very pleased with those.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:43.362
Others are horrifying and he wishes somehow he could erase the connection between those things and the lineage they claim from him which he would.

00:16:44.242 --> 00:16:52.175
There's a German word I don't know if he's lying if you speak the other languages know there's a wonderful German word called Fete Sita

00:16:52.037 --> 00:17:05.859
and it's stronger than the word refuse it's if if you want to refuse something but with real strong emphasis has shifted the how is a German way of saying I know whatever you to do that.

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:16.689
And he would talk and you know in philosophical terms because remember he was a student of philosophy he wrote his doctoral thesis on Ancient Greek philosophy and all the rest.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:24.449
He would wax philosophical and say you know that the idea is you put out or a little bit like having a child.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:34.495
You have a lot of influence but the child is his own or her own person and will find his or her own way and these ideas once they're out there.

00:17:35.203 --> 00:17:46.603
Go their own way and as you said there's a particular way that this idea spread the speed at which it spread throughout the world made it even less able to be sort of stabilized right

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:52.752
and connected back to the origins of where the idea came from the only people who ever really tried that.

00:17:53.163 --> 00:17:59.503
With the Russians After the Revolution because they occupy the position for a while not very long

00:17:59.455 --> 00:18:03.257
but they occupy the position for a while in which

00:18:03.137 --> 00:18:13.880
he was exalted right there have been all these people criticizing capitalism for a long time even the Marxist ever since mid century and these were the first guys,

00:18:13.931 --> 00:18:15.392
who pulled it off.

00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:30.408
They made it and so that there was a kind of presumption around the world their interpretation must be kind of the right one because look they did it and so for a while they could

00:18:30.288 --> 00:18:41.004
enunciate their interpretation and it came to be widely grasped as something which by the way gets called in the literature

00:18:40.956 --> 00:18:55.083
official Marxism the very idea that you would put that adjectives in front of Marxism or Soviet Marxism or Russian my there were these words that were the adjective was meant to somehow say

00:18:54.999 --> 00:19:03.752
kind of this is the Canon we've been depart from it but this is the cannon before the Russian Revolution there was no such thing and.

00:19:04.245 --> 00:19:12.602
By the 1960s it was already displayed it was gone but for a short time 30 40 years.

00:19:13.238 --> 00:19:19.218
It was a kind of and the irony is particularly here in the United States.

00:19:19.558 --> 00:19:27.807
Where the taboo against Marxism kicks in right after World War 2 is so total in this country that.

00:19:28.137 --> 00:19:35.584
I for example through most of my adult life have had to spend a ridiculous amount of my time

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:43.939
simply explaining to American audiences that the Marxism they take as canonical

00:19:43.837 --> 00:19:54.579
is that old Soviet Marxism which wasn't the cannon before 1917 and hasn't been since at least the 1960s

00:19:54.423 --> 00:20:00.044
but they don't know it's not that they're stupid and it's not that they're ignorant it's that,

00:20:00.077 --> 00:20:08.740
will need Millions maybe about any it's not a mental problem it's the taboo shut it down and so all of the reopening

00:20:08.719 --> 00:20:15.807
that in a way re captures what went before and develops it in New Direction they just don't know

00:20:15.768 --> 00:20:27.339
but nevertheless it's a serious attempt at making the implicit ideas explicit the the Russians the Soviets at the beginning of the 20th century

00:20:27.273 --> 00:20:35.522
made a serious attempt at saying okay beyond the critique of capitalism how do we actually build a system like this and so in that sense.

00:20:36.707 --> 00:20:42.309
Not at a high level but at a detailed level it's interesting to look at those particular

00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:56.821
schools may be right because for example let me just take your point one step further you really cannot understand the Cuban Revolution the Chinese Revolution Vietnamese and the others because each of them

00:20:56.728 --> 00:21:01.169
is a kind of response let's call it.

00:21:01.292 --> 00:21:14.916
To the way the Soviets did it are you going to do it that way well yes and no is the answer this we will do that way but that were not going to do and the differences are huge

00:21:14.913 --> 00:21:22.234
but you could find a thread I can do that for you if you want in which all of them are in a way reacting.

00:21:22.925 --> 00:21:24.989
The Originals yes

00:21:24.869 --> 00:21:39.735
very much so like maybe most of rock music is reacting to The Beatles and the stones there's something like that oh can you speak to the unique elements of the various schools of that Soviet Marxism so we got leninism,

00:21:39.804 --> 00:21:49.349
trotskyism stalinism maybe even let's expand out to maoism so maybe I could speak to sort of leninism.

00:21:49.941 --> 00:21:59.855
And please tell me if I'm saying dumb things there's a I think for Lennon there was an idea that there could be a small.

00:21:59.942 --> 00:22:11.126
So the Vanguard party like a small controlling entity that's like wise and is able to do the central planning decisions then for.

00:22:11.258 --> 00:22:20.866
Stalinism when interesting so Stalin's implementation of all of this one interesting characteristic is to move away from the international aspect.

00:22:21.061 --> 00:22:23.432
Of the ideal Marxism to.

00:22:23.609 --> 00:22:31.921
Make it all about Nation nationalism the strength of nation and then Somalia ism is.

00:22:32.332 --> 00:22:40.536
It's different in that it's focused on agriculture and Rural and then trotskyism I don't know.

00:22:40.659 --> 00:22:54.454
Except that it's anti Stalin I mean I don't even know if there's unique sort of philosophical almost there anyway can you maybe from those or something else speak to different unique elements that are interesting to think about,

00:22:54.478 --> 00:23:00.890
about implementation of Marxism in the real world probably the best way to get in the into this.

00:23:01.329 --> 00:23:09.541
Is to describe something that happened in Marxism that then shapes the answer to your question.

00:23:11.006 --> 00:23:13.656
In the early days of Marx's writings.

00:23:13.761 --> 00:23:24.836
And you know he his life spans the 19th centuries born in 1818 dies in 1883 so literally he lives the 19th century and.

00:23:25.221 --> 00:23:32.920
You might mean to make things simple you might look at the first half of the first two-thirds of his life as overwhelmingly.

00:23:33.665 --> 00:23:35.387
Gathering Together.

00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:45.794
The precursors to his own work marks was unusually scholarly in the sense that partly because he didn't work a regular job and partly because he was

00:23:45.728 --> 00:23:56.974
an exile in London most of his adult life he worked in the library I mean he had a lot of time he got subsidized a little bit by angles whose family were manufacturers.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:02.691
And you might say the first half to two-thirds of his life are about.

00:24:03.228 --> 00:24:08.443
The critique of capitalism and that was what.

00:24:08.981 --> 00:24:17.004
In a broad sense the audience for his work Western Europe more or less was interested in that's what they wanted.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:27.294
And he gave that to them he wasn't the only one but he was very very effective at it by the last third of his life.

00:24:28.533 --> 00:24:30.508
He and the other.

00:24:30.748 --> 00:24:40.104
Producers of a anti-capitalist movement people like the chartists in England that's a whole nother movement.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:49.674
The anarchists of various kinds like prudent in France or kropotkin or bakunin and Russia and so on.

00:24:49.986 --> 00:24:59.117
You put all these together and there was a shift in what the audience
let's call it a mixture of.

00:24:59.717 --> 00:25:14.610
Militant Working Class People on the one hand and critical or radical inteligencia on the other they now wanted a different question they were persuaded by the analysis they were agreeable that capitalism

00:25:14.418 --> 00:25:18.490
was a phase they would like to do better than.

00:25:18.631 --> 00:25:32.272
And the question became how do we do this not anymore should we why should we could we maybe fix capital is no they had gotten to the point the system has to be fundamentally changed,

00:25:32.333 --> 00:25:33.587
but they got,

00:25:33.638 --> 00:25:43.435
they didn't go yet where you might imagine they didn't go insane but what will that new system looks like they didn't go that way what they did was ask the question how.

00:25:43.765 --> 00:25:55.453
Could we get Beyond capitalism it seems so powerful it seems to have captured people's minds people's daily lives and so on and the.

00:25:55.549 --> 00:26:10.280
Focus of the conversation became this was already by the last third of the 19th century the question of the agency to mechanism whereby we would get Beyond and again make a long story short.

00:26:10.376 --> 00:26:16.438
The conversation focused on seizing the government.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:26.799
She before that it wasn't that the government was not a major interest if you read Marx's Capital the great work of his maturity three volumes

00:26:26.652 --> 00:26:34.406
there's almost nothing in the in the state he mentions it Polly he's interested in the details of how capitalism works

00:26:34.277 --> 00:26:48.486
Factory by factory store by store author what's the structure the government secondary for him but there's also humans within that capitalist system of there's the working class right it's about that's what I did ruggle

00:26:48.339 --> 00:27:01.701
that's what he's interested in each in the world think of it almost mechanically like the workplace in the workplace there some people who do this and other people who do that and they accept this division of authority and they

00:27:01.527 --> 00:27:07.886
fish division what's going on here particularly because he believed that the core economic.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:16.330
Objective of capitalism was to maximize something called profit which his analysis located right there in the.

00:27:16.444 --> 00:27:26.331
Workings of the Enterprise and not in the government was not that the key factor here and he was looking at ideas of value yes how much is the.

00:27:26.652 --> 00:27:30.175
How much value does the labor of the individual,

00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:41.356
workers provide in that means how do we reward the workers in an ethical way so those are the questions of what would we get here okay but the government

00:27:41.263 --> 00:27:53.149
is real and part of that picture okay so it's very significant that towards the end of the 19th century Marxist still alive on this begins but it's it really gets going after he dies

00:27:52.993 --> 00:27:59.270
is this debate among marxists about the role of the state.

00:27:59.403 --> 00:28:11.298
They all agreed nearly all of them agree that you have to get the say the the working class has to get the state because they see the state as the.

00:28:11.664 --> 00:28:14.691
Ultimate guarantor of

00:28:14.544 --> 00:28:27.763
when things get really out of hand the capitalist calls the police or he calls the army or both of them and so the government is in a sense this key Institution

00:28:27.661 --> 00:28:35.513
captured in marches Lang Marxist Language by the bourgeoisie by the by the other side the capitalists.

00:28:35.745 --> 00:28:48.153
And yet vulnerable because of suffrage if suffrage is universal or nearly so if everybody gets a vote which in a way capitalism brings to bear

00:28:48.132 --> 00:28:55.256
part of its rejection of feudalism in the French American Revolution is to create a place where

00:28:55.082 --> 00:29:04.105
elected represented so that the government being subject to suffrage creates the notion aha.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.328
Here's how we're going to we have to seize the state.

00:29:07.523 --> 00:29:15.033
And then that gets agreed upon but there's a big split as to how to do it one side says.

00:29:15.229 --> 00:29:24.630
You go with the election you you mobilize the voter that gets to be called reform ISM within Marxism and the other side

00:29:24.573 --> 00:29:38.295
is Revolution don't do that this system if I may quote burning again is rigged you can't get there they've long ago learned how to manipulate parliament's.

00:29:38.419 --> 00:29:46.298
They by the politicians and all that and therefore Revolution is going to be the way to do it Revolution.

00:29:46.827 --> 00:29:59.397
Gets a very big boost because the Russians they did it that way they didn't do I mean they fought in the Duma in the in the parliament but they didn't and that this focus on the state,

00:29:59.466 --> 00:30:00.666
I would argue.

00:30:01.491 --> 00:30:11.118
Goes Way Beyond what The Debaters at the time and if you're interested in the great names there was a great theorist of the.

00:30:11.619 --> 00:30:18.860
The role of the state in a reformist strategy to get power in Germany named Edward Bernstein,

00:30:18.929 --> 00:30:22.479
very important his opponents in Germany.

00:30:22.665 --> 00:30:37.539
Were Karl kautsky and Rosa Luxemburg the two other huge figures in Marxism at the time and they wrote the articles that everybody reads but it was a much broader debate by the way that debate still goes on.

00:30:37.861 --> 00:30:40.051
Reform as a revolution.

00:30:40.129 --> 00:30:49.089
And in terms of not all that different I mean it's adjusted to history but in terms of different can you comment on where you.

00:30:49.167 --> 00:30:57.209
Lean in terms of the mechanism of progress Reformation verses and rather show you the historical shirt.

00:30:57.882 --> 00:31:02.773
Over and over and over again in most cases the reformists have always won.

00:31:02.968 --> 00:31:08.516
Because Revolution is frightening is scary is dangerous.

00:31:08.747 --> 00:31:21.777
And so most of the time when you get to the point where it's even a relevant discussion not a abstract thing for conferences but a real strategic issue the reformists have one I mean and.

00:31:22.674 --> 00:31:37.098
I'll give you an example from the United States in the Great Depression of the 1930s you had an extraordinary shift to the left in the United States the greatest shift to the left in the country's history before or since,

00:31:37.122 --> 00:31:46.461
nothing like it suddenly you created a vast left-wing composed of the labor movement.

00:31:46.746 --> 00:31:47.352
Which,

00:31:47.421 --> 00:31:59.721
when crazy in the 19th are we we organize more people into unions in the 1930 then at any time before or any time since it is the explosion and at the same time the explosion of

00:31:59.574 --> 00:32:07.724
two socialist parties and the Communist party that became very powerful and they all work together creating

00:32:07.667 --> 00:32:17.357
very powerful leftist president in this country they debated in a strategically real way reform or revolution

00:32:17.219 --> 00:32:26.782
the reformers were the Union people by and large and the the Communists were the revolutionaries by and large because they were affiliated with the

00:32:26.698 --> 00:32:37.315
the Communist International with Russia and all of that and in between you might say that the two socialist parties one that was trotskyist and inspiration and the other one

00:32:37.141 --> 00:32:43.697
more moderate Western European kind of socialism and they had this intense debate

00:32:43.649 --> 00:32:51.313
and the ended up the reformist won that debate there was no revolution in the 1930s here but there was.

00:32:51.832 --> 00:33:01.819
A reform that achieved unspeakably great successes which is why it was as strong and remains as strong as it does because it achieved.

00:33:01.906 --> 00:33:14.602
In a few years in the 1930s started around 1930 23 Social Security in this country we had never had that before that's the same one we have now unemployment insurance never existed before.

00:33:14.698 --> 00:33:24.441
You have till today minimum wage for the first time still have that today and a federal program of employment that I hired 15 million people

00:33:24.348 --> 00:33:36.639
these were unspeakable gifts if you like to the working class that the 30s and the 40s 30s very much in the 40s anymore but in the 30s and here's the best part.

00:33:36.871 --> 00:33:40.510
It was paid for by taxes on corporations and the rich,

00:33:40.535 --> 00:33:49.207
so when people today say where you can tags are going the joke is I have to teach American history to Americans,

00:33:49.222 --> 00:34:01.216
because it has been erased from Consciousness will return to that but first let's take a stroll back to the beginning of the 20th century with the Russians with the Russians so.

00:34:01.528 --> 00:34:05.267
Their interpretation goes like this.

00:34:07.136 --> 00:34:15.385
Everybody was right the state is crucial we were right we were the revolutionaries we seized the state here in Russia.

00:34:16.147 --> 00:34:21.579
Now we have the state and socialism is when the working class.

00:34:21.693 --> 00:34:34.983
Captures this state either by three former Revolution and then uses its power over the state to make the transition from capitalism to the better thing we're going toward.

00:34:35.979 --> 00:34:44.913
Elegant make a long story short in the interest of time what happens which is not unusual in human history is that the means.

00:34:45.666 --> 00:34:52.529
Becomes the end in other words Lennon whose Crystal Clear before he don't live very long he dies it,

00:34:52.571 --> 00:35:06.824
23 so he's only in power from 17 state of 22 but that time he has his brain trouble and that's 1923 by the way not at age 23 yeah so for listening and 1923 yeah he's only there for 45 years

00:35:06.668 --> 00:35:12.937
he's very clear even says I've done work on that published so I am and all this stuff,

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:18.716
he says in a famous speech Let's Not fool ourselves we have captured the state.

00:35:19.208 --> 00:35:25.999
But we don't have socialism we have to create that we have to move towards that.

00:35:26.977 --> 00:35:38.989
With Stalin you know Lenin dies and there's a fight between Stalin and Trotsky Trotsky loses the fight he's exiled it goes to Mexico Stalin is now alone in power and does all the things

00:35:38.923 --> 00:35:46.794
he's famous or inFAMOUS for and by the end of the 20s Stalin makes.

00:35:47.052 --> 00:35:57.444
A decision I mean not in a thought that he makes it alone but things have evolved in Russia so that they do the following they declare that they are,

00:35:57.459 --> 00:36:02.467
socialism in other words socialism becomes

00:36:02.392 --> 00:36:15.052
when you capture the state not when the state capture has enabled you to do XYZ other things no no the state itself once you have it

00:36:14.968 --> 00:36:23.335
is socialism so when a socialist captures the state that's socialism exactly and hit eight that's exactly right.

00:36:23.539 --> 00:36:32.733
And that feel like there's definitionally confusing well it shouldn't be because I give you an example yeah if you go to many parts of the United States today.

00:36:32.883 --> 00:36:40.349
And you ask people what socialism they'll tell you they look you right in the face and they'll say the post office.

00:36:41.354 --> 00:36:50.917
You know when I first heard this as healing the air you know what the post office it took me a while to understand the post office

00:36:50.834 --> 00:37:00.235
Amtrak the Tennessee River all the examples in the United States where the government runs something this is,

00:37:00.241 --> 00:37:01.486
socialism.

00:37:01.564 --> 00:37:14.665
See capitalism is if the government doesn't run it if a private individual who's not a government official runs it well then it's capitalism if the government takes it.

00:37:14.924 --> 00:37:18.752
Then it's socialist so what is wrong with that

00:37:18.651 --> 00:37:32.868
reasoning so the idea I think there's nothing wrong with it's a way of looking at the world it's just got nothing to do with marks but there's marks there's Marxism let's try to pull this apart so what role.

00:37:33.738 --> 00:37:44.562
The central planning have in Marxism so Marxism is concerned with this class struggle.

00:37:45.441 --> 00:37:48.406
With respecting the working class right.

00:37:49.312 --> 00:37:58.227
What is the connection between that struggle and Central planning that is often Central planning is often associated with Marxism

00:37:58.215 --> 00:38:00.541
fright so centralized power

00:38:00.457 --> 00:38:13.945
doing Russia did that allocation so that's a that's that has to do with a very specific set of implementations initiated by the Soviet Union has nothing to do with marks how else can you do I don't think you can find

00:38:13.861 --> 00:38:16.340
yes anywhere in Marx's writings

00:38:16.292 --> 00:38:28.133
anything about Central planning or any other kind of planning again fundamentally then marks Marxist work it has to do with.

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:32.328
Factories Woodworkers with with the bourgeoisie with

00:38:32.244 --> 00:38:43.608
and the the exploitation of the working classes I but you still have to take that leap what is beyond capitalism right so maybe we should

00:38:43.542 --> 00:38:46.426
Turn To That explicit yes on that okay

00:38:46.333 --> 00:38:58.957
yes what okay we've ready look historically at several attempts to go beyond capitalism how else can we go beyond capitalism let me push a little further they didn't succeed

00:38:58.873 --> 00:39:05.915
it might judgement as a Marxist and I'm now going to tell you why they didn't succeed because they didn't.

00:39:06.093 --> 00:39:11.407
Understand as well as they could have or should have what Marx is was trying to do.

00:39:11.629 --> 00:39:21.786
I think I would have been like them if I had lived at their time under their circles this is not a critique of them but it's a different way of understanding what's going on all right so.

00:39:21.919 --> 00:39:28.331
Give you an example most of my adult life I have taught marxian economics.

00:39:29.084 --> 00:39:36.091
I'm a professor of Economics I've been at all my life I'm a graduate of American universities.

00:39:36.529 --> 00:39:42.924
As it happens I'm a graduate of what in this country passes for its best universities.

00:39:43.668 --> 00:39:54.590
Let's talk another conversation you and I can have so I went to Harvard and then I went to Stanford and I finished a Yale I'm like a poster boy for Elite Education.

00:39:55.083 --> 00:40:04.097
They tried very hard by the way I had I spent 10 years of my life in the ivy league 20 semesters one after the other no break.

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:11.632
In those twenty semesters 19 of them never mentioned a word about Marx's.

00:40:12.412 --> 00:40:19.104
That is no critique of capitalism was offered to me ever with one except one professor

00:40:19.074 --> 00:40:33.651
in Stanford in the one semester I studied with him he gave me plenty to read but nobody else so that's really interesting you've mentioned that in the past and that's very true which makes you a very interesting figure.

00:40:34.288 --> 00:40:41.402
To hold your ground intellectually through this idea space we're just people.

00:40:41.598 --> 00:40:49.081
Don't really even talk about it perhaps we can discuss historically why that is but nevertheless that's the case so.

00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:57.210
Moxie in economics did Karl Marx come up in conversation as a kind of dismissive,

00:40:57.244 --> 00:41:12.046
the best example yeah he came up only as an object of dismissal for giving example the major textbook and economics that I was taught with and that pig was for many years the canonical book isn't quite anymore.

00:41:12.178 --> 00:41:21.291
Was a book authored by a professor of Economics at MIT named Paul Samuelson and people kind of you know a whole generation or two

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:27.593
what drained on his textbook if you open the cover of its textbook he has a tree.

00:41:27.689 --> 00:41:39.188
And you know and the tree is Adam Smith and David Ricardo at the root and then the different branches of he's trying to give you an idea as a student of how the thing.

00:41:39.599 --> 00:41:49.568
And it's a tree and everybody on it is the Bourgeois and then this is one little Branch goes off like this and so starts heading back down

00:41:49.484 --> 00:42:00.046
that's Karl Marx in other words he had to have it Complete because he's not a complete Faker but beyond that no there was no nothing in the book gives you.

00:42:00.223 --> 00:42:03.602
Two paragraphs of an approach.

00:42:04.121 --> 00:42:14.306
But that's Cold War I mean that's really that's really neither here to that that's the craziness yeah that's the Cold War in this country my professors were afraid of anyway let me get to the.

00:42:14.546 --> 00:42:22.129
To the core of it when I think it will help Marx was interested in the relationship of people

00:42:22.126 --> 00:42:36.892
in the process of production that he's interested in the factory the officers store what goes on and by that he means what are the relationships among the people that come together in a workplace.

00:42:37.358 --> 00:42:38.981
And.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:49.100
What he analyzes is that there is something going on there that has not been adequately understood.

00:42:49.178 --> 00:42:56.500
And that has not been adequately addressed as an object needing transformation

00:42:56.434 --> 00:43:04.566
what does he mean the answer is exploitation which he defines mathematically in the following way.

00:43:05.139 --> 00:43:10.399
Whenever in a society any society you organized.

00:43:10.513 --> 00:43:18.141
People suck adults not to children not to sicken but you know healthy adults
in the following way.

00:43:18.732 --> 00:43:21.166
A big block of them a clear majority.

00:43:21.586 --> 00:43:31.293
Work that is they use their brains and their muscles to transform nature a tree into a chair a sheep into a wool sweater whatever.

00:43:31.912 --> 00:43:39.485
In every human Community marks argues there are the people who do that work but they always produce.

00:43:39.879 --> 00:43:45.589
More chairs more sweaters more hamburgers than they themselves consume.

00:43:45.703 --> 00:43:54.753
Whatever their standard of living doesn't have to be low to be medium can be hard but they always produce more than they themselves.

00:43:55.344 --> 00:44:10.030
That more by The Wager marks when he writes this uses the German word Mayor mhr which is the English equivalent of more it's the more that more got badly translated into the word

00:44:09.964 --> 00:44:13.451
Surplus shouldn't it in,

00:44:13.502 --> 00:44:21.841
but it was by the way by German and English people doing the translations what's the difference between more and surplus is there a nuanced

00:44:21.784 --> 00:44:35.155
yeah because Surplus has a notion of its discretionary it's sort of extra he's not taking a not making a judgment that it's a simple math equation yes very simple one - together

00:44:35.053 --> 00:44:35.722
yes

00:44:35.603 --> 00:44:48.073
x minus X is X is the total output Y is the consumption by the producer therefore x minus y equals s the Surplus exactly.

00:44:48.188 --> 00:44:50.243
Now Marx argues.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:59.687
The quit the minute you understand this you will ask the following question who gets the Surplus.

00:44:59.792 --> 00:45:08.239
Who gets this extra stuff that is made but not consumed by those who made it and Marx's answer is.

00:45:08.434 --> 00:45:16.818
Therein lies one of the great Shapers of any society how is that organized for example who gets it

00:45:16.725 --> 00:45:30.843
what are they asked if anything to do with it in real exchange forgetting you what's their social role for example here we go now if you get this and you get the core of it anyway

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:33.859
and I don't charge much,

00:45:33.865 --> 00:45:45.238
the workers themselves will get less than lawyers that that's right the workers themselves could get it yes that's the closest marks comes to a definition of communism,

00:45:45.271 --> 00:45:52.557
communism would would be if the workers who produce the Surplus together

00:45:52.473 --> 00:46:01.442
decide what to do with it so this has to do not just with who gets it but more importantly who gets to decide who gets it.

00:46:01.673 --> 00:46:04.971
Who gets it and who gets to decide what to do with it.

00:46:05.256 --> 00:46:15.170
Because you can't decide it if you don't have disposition over it so the the lot this the logic of the word sequence it's produced.

00:46:15.312 --> 00:46:23.560
It's box uses the word appropriated in other words whose property who gets to decide if you like what happens

00:46:23.468 --> 00:46:34.895
all the property ever meant is who gets to desire and whose excluded that's a clean definition of communism for right that's the by the way it's not just clean the only one

00:46:34.793 --> 00:46:41.016
so what's can we just Linger on the definition of exploitation yes contacts easy

00:46:40.905 --> 00:46:50.783
becomes very easy to exploitation exists if and when the Surplus that's produced is taken and distributed by people

00:46:50.673 --> 00:46:56.158
other than those who produced it slaves produces Surplus which the master gets

00:46:56.092 --> 00:47:02.243
surfs producer Surplus which the Lord gets employees produce a surplus

00:47:02.151 --> 00:47:06.610
which the employer gets it's very simple,

00:47:06.679 --> 00:47:16.881
these are exploited t''v class structures because one class produces a surplus appropriated.

00:47:17.013 --> 00:47:18.510
Distributed,

00:47:18.517 --> 00:47:32.527
by another group of people who not the ones who produced it which creates hostility and midi Envy anger resentment and all of the problems you can lump under the heading

00:47:32.515 --> 00:47:40.422
class struggle I use a metaphor simple metaphorical story you have two children let's assume

00:47:40.329 --> 00:47:55.204
and you take them to Central Park a few blocks from here it's a nice day and the children are playing and incomes one of those men with a ice cream truck comes by ding a ling a ling a ling your children's either ice cream daddy get me an ice cream

00:47:55.165 --> 00:48:02.333
so you walk over you take some money and you get two ice cream cones and you give them to one of the children.

00:48:03.195 --> 00:48:06.250
The other one begins to scream and yell and how.

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:13.280
Obviously what's the issue and you realize you've just made a terrible mistake so you order.

00:48:13.701 --> 00:48:19.852
The one you gave the two ice cream cones to give one of those to your sister or your brother or whatever it is.

00:48:20.452 --> 00:48:29.853
And that that's how you solve the problem until a psychologist comes along and says you know you didn't fix it by what you just did.

00:48:30.517 --> 00:48:33.931
You should never have done that in the first place.

00:48:34.541 --> 00:48:45.058
My response so you understand all of the efforts to deal with inequality in economic political cultural these are all.

00:48:45.551 --> 00:48:54.492
Giving the ice cream cone back to the kid you should you should never do this in the first place a reallocation of resources creates bitterness and heartless

00:48:54.409 --> 00:49:04.224
look at our weave this country is tearing itself apart now in a way that I had never seen in my life and I've lived here all my life and I've worked here all my life.

00:49:04.401 --> 00:49:18.430
It's tearing itself apart and it's tearing itself apart basically over the read division the redistribution of wealth having so badly distributed in the fur but that's all in marks.

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:26.928
And notice as I explained to you what is going on in this tension-filled production seen in the officer Factory the store.

00:49:27.195 --> 00:49:37.677
I don't have to say a word about the government not interested in the government the government's really have a very secondary matter to this core question and here comes the big.

00:49:38.529 --> 00:49:45.977
If you make a revolution and all you do is remove the private exploiter.

00:49:46.082 --> 00:49:52.683
And substitute a government official without changing the relationship you know,

00:49:52.716 --> 00:50:02.559
you can call yourself a Marxist all day long but you're not getting the point of the Marxism the point was not who the exploiter is but the exploitation

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:17.484
per se you got to change the organization of the workplace so there isn't a group that makes all the decisions and gets the Surplus very visibly another one that produces it if you do that you will destroy

00:50:17.311 --> 00:50:18.979
the whole project you will

00:50:18.976 --> 00:50:28.323
not only will you not achieve what you set out to get but you'll so misunderstand it that you the Germans again have a phrase is gay chief

00:50:28.311 --> 00:50:33.977
it goes crooked it doesn't go right the project gets off the rails because it can't

00:50:33.857 --> 00:50:41.854
it can understand either what its objective should have been and therefore it doesn't understand how and why it's missing,

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:51.144
it's subjective it just knows that this is not what it had hoped for when there's a lot of has any questions here so one is.

00:50:51.312 --> 00:50:57.077
To what degree that is human nature to what degree.

00:50:57.317 --> 00:51:06.340
This communism a lack of exploitation of the working class naturally emerge if you leave two people together

00:51:06.292 --> 00:51:17.584
in a room and come back a year later if you leave five people together in a room if you leave a hundred people and 1,000 people it seems that humans form hierarchies,

00:51:17.653 --> 00:51:19.771
naturally,

00:51:19.831 --> 00:51:28.936
so the the clever the charismatic the sexy the the muscular the powerful what however you define that starts.

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:41.188
Start you know becoming a leader and start to do maybe exploitation in a non negative sense a more generic sense starts to become an employer

00:51:41.077 --> 00:51:50.847
not in the capitalist has but just as a human here you go do this and in exchange I will give you this just becomes the leadership role right so the question is

00:51:50.772 --> 00:51:56.420
yes okay it would be nice the idea sort of Communism would be nice too,

00:51:56.462 --> 00:52:10.211
it's nice and still in the weary but it doesn't work in practice because of human nature because of human nature that's thank you so what what can we say about leveraging human nature to achieve some of these ends.

00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:20.267
There's so many ways of responding in no particular order here are some of them
the history of the human race.

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:27.288
As best I can tell is a history in which a succession of,

00:52:27.348 --> 00:52:35.903
social forms forms of society arise
and as they do they.

00:52:36.945 --> 00:52:44.177
Rule out some kinds of human behavior on the grounds that they are socially disruptive and unacceptable.

00:52:44.714 --> 00:52:47.868
The argument isn't really then.

00:52:48.288 --> 00:53:00.579
Is there a need or an instinct is there some human nature that makes people want to do this well whatever that is this has to be repressed or else we don't have a society

00:53:00.495 --> 00:53:11.147
and Freud helps us to understand that that repression is going on all the time and it has consequences it's not a finished project you repress it

00:53:11.144 --> 00:53:14.928
it's gone it doesn't work like that so for example.

00:53:15.421 --> 00:53:29.017
When you get a bunch of people together at some point they may develop animosities towards one another that lead them to want the other person or persons to disappear to be dead to be gone.

00:53:29.131 --> 00:53:38.577
But we don't permit you to do that we just don't
every economic system that has ever existed.

00:53:38.988 --> 00:53:41.989
Has included people who defend it.

00:53:42.391 --> 00:53:55.924
On the grounds that it is the only system consistent with human nature and that every effort to go beyond it has to fail because it contradicts Human Nature,

00:53:55.976 --> 00:54:03.550
I can show you English documents of every tribal Society I've ever studied every anthropological

00:54:03.529 --> 00:54:17.035
community that has ever been studied slavery wherever it's existed I can show you how endless documents in which the Defenders of those systems not all of them of course but many Defenders used that

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:26.676
argument to naturalize a system is a way to hold on to it to prevent it from going to to counter the argument

00:54:26.601 --> 00:54:35.859
that every system is born every system evolves and then every system dies and therefore capitalism since it was born

00:54:35.856 --> 00:54:42.835
since it's been developing we all know what the next stage of capitalism is working in fur.

00:54:42.986 --> 00:54:51.739
The burden is on the people who think it isn't gonna guess it doesn't mean they're wrong but what you're saying is if you look at history.

00:54:51.952 --> 00:55:04.513
You're deeply suspicious of the argument this is going against human nature because we keep using that for basically everything including toxic relationship toxic systems absolutely destructive systems that said.

00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:13.668
Well let me just ask a million different questions so so one what about the the argument that sort of the employer,

00:55:13.692 --> 00:55:17.800
the capitalist takes on risk.

00:55:18.067 --> 00:55:26.370
So the yeah versus the employee who just they're doing the labor the the capitalist is actually putting up a lot of risk

00:55:26.259 --> 00:55:39.000
what's are they not in sort of aggregating this organization and taking this giant effort hiring a lot of people aren't they taking on risk that this is going to be a giant failure,

00:55:39.025 --> 00:55:41.008
first of all there's risk.

00:55:42.112 --> 00:55:54.043
Almost in everything you undertake any project that begins now and ends in the future had takes a risk that between now and that future something's going to happen that makes it not work out,

00:55:54.095 --> 00:55:57.023
I mean I got into a cab.

00:55:57.119 --> 00:56:10.733
Before I came here today in order to do this with you I took a risk I could the cab could have been an accident and lightning could have hit us a bear could have eaten my left foot who the hell knows shouldn't I reward you for the risk you took,

00:56:10.776 --> 00:56:20.987
hold it a second results do this step by step so everybody's taking a risk I always found it wonderful you talk about risk and that you imagine it's only some of us

00:56:20.903 --> 00:56:26.740
who take a risk let's go with the worker in live with the capitalist that worker.

00:56:27.223 --> 00:56:33.626
He moved his family from Michigan to Pennsylvania to take that job.

00:56:33.776 --> 00:56:37.326
He had he made a decision to have children,

00:56:37.386 --> 00:56:50.424
they are teenagers they're now in school at a time when their friendships are crucial to their development you can yank them out of the school because his job is gone he took an enormous risk.

00:56:51.079 --> 00:56:53.719
To do that job everyday.

00:56:53.987 --> 00:57:01.542
To forestall all the other things he could have done he was taking a risk that this job would be here tomorrow,

00:57:01.612 --> 00:57:13.893
next month next year he bought a house which Americans only do with mortgages which means he's now stuck he has to make a monthly payment if you make a mistake.

00:57:14.278 --> 00:57:21.347
You capitalist he's the one who's going to your a capital you got a lot of money otherwise you wouldn't be in that position.

00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:24.903
You got you've got a cushion he doesn't.

00:57:25.567 --> 00:57:35.616
If you investigate you'll see that in every business I've ever been I've been involved in a lot of them so you think is possible to actually measure risk or is your best argument is there's risk involved in

00:57:35.406 --> 00:57:43.547
in a lot of both the working class and the bourgeoisie the capitalist that's right and it's very good worker the worker would never come and say.

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:50.091
Because she's been taught right I want this payment a wage.

00:57:50.503 --> 00:57:57.257
For the work I do and I want this page this payment for the risk I take,

00:57:57.282 --> 00:58:11.949
well there's some level of communication like that to you you have acknowledgement of dangerous jobs but that's probably built into the salary all those kinds of things you understood but you're not incorporating you don't real full spectrum of risk language you don't believe that.

00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:25.390
This country is now being literally transformed From Below by an army of workers who work at Amazon fast food joints you know what their complaint is it's killing us.

00:58:25.639 --> 00:58:27.415
We get paid shit.

00:58:27.862 --> 00:58:41.306
And it's killing us there is no relationship except in the minds of the Defenders of capitalism between the ugliness that difficulty the danger of labor on the one hand and the wage

00:58:41.276 --> 00:58:48.714
let me give you just a couple of examples please this is my this my job it's my life what I do all right the median income.

00:58:49.243 --> 00:59:01.902
Of a child care worker in the United States right now as we speak is $11.22 an hour median so 50% May class 50% make more,

00:59:01.945 --> 00:59:06.557
the median income for car park attendant.

00:59:06.725 --> 00:59:14.938
Is several dollars per hour higher than that what does the car park attendant do he stares at your car.

00:59:15.511 --> 00:59:25.075
For many hours to make sure that nobody comes and grabs it maybe he Parks it and moves it around to get it in and out

00:59:25.027 --> 00:59:31.727
by any measure that I know of that makes any rational sense being in charge of,

00:59:31.742 --> 00:59:45.221
of toddlers to 34 year-olds who are at the key moment of mental formation the first five years to do to give that a lower salary than you give the guy who watches your car

00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:47.436
come on I know how to explain it.

00:59:48.063 --> 00:59:56.690
Gender explained all kinds of issues at the car park people are males and the day the childcare people are females and that

00:59:56.634 --> 01:00:03.262
I didn't our culture is a very big marker of what but the one who said only the economics professor.

01:00:03.808 --> 01:00:16.153
Nobody else says this stuff because in economic I don't know if you were familiar with our profession but we have something which we call marginal product this is a this is a fantasy.

01:00:16.601 --> 01:00:26.407
I was a mathematician before I became an economist I loved mathematics I specialized in mathematics so I know mathematics pretty well.

01:00:26.503 --> 01:00:34.473
What economists do is silly is childish but they think it's mathematics or a fifth kid it is but.

01:00:34.758 --> 01:00:43.223
Think for a minute what it means to suggest that you can identify the marginal product.

01:00:43.886 --> 01:00:55.223
Of a factor of production like a worker in the textbook when it's taught I've taught this stuff I hold my nose but I teach it then I explain to students what I just taught you is

01:00:55.094 --> 01:01:00.688
horse shit but I first I teach it what is the marginal product if I might be useful it's an ocean is.

01:01:00.937 --> 01:01:06.845
If you take away one worker right now from the pile what will be the diminution.

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:16.432
Over the output that's the marginal product of that worker measured by the amount of the output that diminishes.

01:01:16.835 --> 01:01:18.998
Output of the raw product

01:01:18.842 --> 01:01:37.129
of the product usually in real terms of physical not the value you could do a value but it's really more the physical your if I mean I there is a transformation thing well I'd love to talk to you about about value is so interesting yeah what is value be glad to talk to you about value and price and all of that

01:01:36.964 --> 01:01:38.704
but I just want to get to it.

01:01:39.737 --> 01:01:50.524
Hagel who is Marx's teacher has a famous line you can't step in this in the same river twice and the argument is you and the river have changed,

01:01:50.557 --> 01:02:03.082
between the first and the second time so it's a different you and it's a different you can choose not to pay attention to that just you can't claim you're not doing that you can't claim that you can actually do that because you can.

01:02:03.196 --> 01:02:04.441
There is no way

01:02:04.439 --> 01:02:19.340
to do that so the the meaning that you can't just remove a worker and have a clean mathematical calculation of the effect that it has on the outputs one because too many other things are going on too many things are changing and you cannot assume.

01:02:19.455 --> 01:02:22.500
Much as you want to that the outcome.

01:02:22.596 --> 01:02:29.504
On the output side is uniquely determined by the change you made on the input side

01:02:29.501 --> 01:02:33.969
can't do that even in the even in the average it's not going to work out

01:02:33.867 --> 01:02:44.403
you can take a look at mathematics is full of abstractions you can abstract you can say as as we do an economic Catalyst paribus you know everything else held constant.

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:48.472
But you have to know what you just did you held everything cuz you know why you do that

01:02:48.289 --> 01:03:01.246
because you can't do that in the real world that's not possible you better account for that otherwise you're mistaking the abstraction from the messy reality you abstracted from to get the,

01:03:01.882 --> 01:03:16.703
as a quick tangent if we somehow went through a thought experiment or an actual experiment of removing every single economists from the world will be better off or worse off much better off okay economics if and I'm one

01:03:16.610 --> 01:03:27.703
you know I'm talking about myself see economics going to ship ship all the economies to Mars and still don't see how it works off but the serious part of this is that economics.

01:03:29.384 --> 01:03:41.108
You know it's really about capitalism economics as a discipline is born with cap and there was no such thing when I teach I teach courses at the University for example call history of economic thought.

01:03:41.276 --> 01:03:44.808
All right and I begin the students with Aristotle and Plato.

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:55.368
And I say you know they talked about really interesting things but he never called it economic there was no it meant it made no sense to People Too abstract,

01:03:59.551 --> 01:04:13.849
economics broadly defy it made no sense that's a creation much much later that's capitalism that did that created the feel of so when I give them Plato and Aristotle I have to give them particular passages.

01:04:14.134 --> 01:04:15.587
By the way football.

01:04:15.674 --> 01:04:28.064
Because your audience will like it Plato and Aristotle talked about markets because they lived at a time in ancient Greece when Market relations were beginning to intrude upon these

01:04:27.953 --> 01:04:29.153
societies

01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:43.710
so they were both interested in this phenomenon that we're not just producing goods and then Distributing among us we're doing it in a quid pro quo you know I'll give you three oranges you give me two shirts a market exchange

01:04:43.572 --> 01:04:49.804
and both Aristotle and Plato hated markets denounced them and for the same reason.

01:04:50.026 --> 01:05:05.369
They destroy social cohesion they destroy Community they make some people rich and other people poor and they set us against each other and is terrible and that here's what they agreed on that here's what they disagreed on one of them

01:05:05.249 --> 01:05:14.516
I said okay that can be no markets that was Plato Aristotle comes back and says no no no too late for that,

01:05:14.531 --> 01:05:25.948
the disruption caused it in society by getting rid of this institution that has crawled in amongst us would be too devastating so we can't do that

01:05:25.901 --> 01:05:29.063
but what we can do is control it,

01:05:29.105 --> 01:05:39.731
regulated get from the market what it does reasonably well and prevent it from doing the destructive things it does so badly

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:54.387
so the the fundamentally the destructive thing of a market is that the engine of capitalism and so it creates exploitation of the worker it facility I wouldn't concede that's to facilitate facilitates it and it is an institution

01:05:54.213 --> 01:05:56.520
that Plato and Aristotle feel

01:05:56.427 --> 01:06:05.099
is a terrible danger to community is there which by the way is a way of thinking about it that exists right now all over the world,

01:06:05.123 --> 01:06:12.157
look the medieval Catholic church had a Doctrine the prohibition of usury.

01:06:13.198 --> 01:06:22.078
You know it and this was that God said if there's a person who needs to borrow from you then that's a person in need.

01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:26.101
And the good Christian thing to do is to help him.

01:06:26.666 --> 01:06:33.294
To demand an interest payment rather than to help your fellow man is.

01:06:33.535 --> 01:06:43.080
God hates you for that that's a sin Jesus is crying all the way to wherever it is he goes but would Jesus be crying,

01:06:43.104 --> 01:06:52.055
when you try to scale that system so that has to do with the intimate human interaction the idea of markets as you're able.

01:06:53.069 --> 01:07:02.534
To create a system that involves thousands millions of humans and there'd be some level of safe.

01:07:02.927 --> 01:07:06.315
Self-regulating fairness.

01:07:06.636 --> 01:07:16.613
There might be but it's hard to imagine that charging interest would be the way to do that wonder what so I guess opposed you suppose you were interested in having.

01:07:16.817 --> 01:07:22.843
Suppose you took us your problem we have a set of funds that can be loaned out.

01:07:23.596 --> 01:07:28.478
People don't want to consume it they ready to lend it okay.

01:07:29.412 --> 01:07:36.976
To whom should they lend it what we could say in our society we're going to run this the way professors

01:07:36.974 --> 01:07:46.573
institutions like MIT work this they write up a project they send the project into some government office.

01:07:46.732 --> 01:07:55.638
Where it is looked at against other projects and this office in the government decides what kind of fund this one,

01:07:55.662 --> 01:08:02.876
and that one because they're more not needed in our society we are in Greater need of solving this problem

01:08:02.684 --> 01:08:12.085
then that problem and so we're going to lend money to people working on this problem more readily or more money than we lend over here because we're going to.

01:08:12.379 --> 01:08:15.731
But instead what we do is who can pay the highest interest rate.

01:08:16.016 --> 01:08:30.774
Whoa what what what do you do it why what ethics would justify you do it it's like a market in general something is in shortage or markets are about how to handle shortage that's one basic way to understand it.

01:08:31.401 --> 01:08:36.436
And so if the demand is greater than the supply which is all the word shortage.

01:08:36.596 --> 01:08:46.258
Means has no other meaning if the demand is greater than the supply okay now you got a problem you can't satisfy all the demand errs.

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:58.501
Because you don't have enough Supply you have a shortage okay now how are you going to do it in a market you will allow people who have a lot of money to bid up the price of whatever is short.

01:08:58.615 --> 01:09:02.030
That solves your problem because as the price goes up.

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:12.751
The poor people can of they drop out they can't buy the thing at the end exalted price so you've got a way of Distributing the shortage it goes to the people with the most money.

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:19.341
At this point most human beings confronted with this explanation of a market.

01:09:19.644 --> 01:09:25.787
Would turn against it because it contradicts their Christian judaic Islamic all of them.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.538
What's what you know what that means it means that a rich person can get the scarce milk and give it to their cat.

01:09:33.688 --> 01:09:48.040
While the poor foot person has no milk for their five children there it is you want to Market why do the fundamental thing that seems unfair there's the resulting inequality now or death.

01:09:48.299 --> 01:09:53.226
Or death well that's the ultimate inequality yes it is what about.

01:09:53.673 --> 01:10:06.927
We're going to jump around from the philosophical from the economics to the sort of debate type of thing what about sort of the lifting ties raise all boats meaning.

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:10.267
If we look at the 20th century right.

01:10:10.858 --> 01:10:20.260
A lot of people maybe you disagree with this but they attribute a lot of the Innovation and the average Improvement in the quality of life

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:26.174
to capitalism to inventions and Innovation to engineering.

01:10:26.252 --> 01:10:40.938
And science developments that resulted from competition and all those kinds of forces so not looking at the individual unfairness of exploitation as its.

01:10:41.043 --> 01:10:52.964
Specifically defined but just observing historically looking at 20th Century we came up with a lot of cool stuff that seemed to have made life easier and better on average.

01:10:53.187 --> 01:11:02.165
What do you say that I have several responses to that but I do disagree pretty far fundamentally

01:11:02.045 --> 01:11:12.887
with what's going on there but let me give you the argument so you that you can hear them and then you can evaluate them as can anybody who's listening or watching

01:11:16.242 --> 01:11:28.541
Marx was a student of Hegel and one of hegel's central arguments was that everything that exists exists quote in the contradiction in simple English.

01:11:28.629 --> 01:11:31.279
There's a good and bad side if you like to everything

01:11:31.213 --> 01:11:42.748
and you won't understand it unless you accept that proposition and start looking for the good things that are the other side of the bad ones and the bad things that are the other side of the good ones Etc

01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:47.888
so the dialectic yes exactly and marks very attentive to that.

01:11:48.218 --> 01:11:56.899
Explicitly agrees with this on many occasions and applies it of course to the central object of his research,

01:11:56.950 --> 01:12:04.343
capitalism so this is not a simple minded fellow who's telling you all the bad things about capitalism

01:12:04.197 --> 01:12:12.391
as if there were nothing that this system achieved or accomplished and one of the things he celebrates a lot is.

01:12:12.515 --> 01:12:18.559
The technological dynamism of the system which marks takes to be

01:12:18.448 --> 01:12:29.208
profound because you know he lived at the time when major breakthroughs in textile technology and Mining in chemistry and so on were achieved

01:12:29.187 --> 01:12:38.912
but as to the notion that that capitalism is therefore responsible for the Improvement in

01:12:38.775 --> 01:12:46.861
in the quality or the standard of living of the mass of people marks time comes back and says oh wait a minute here

01:12:46.805 --> 01:12:51.911
number one capitalism as a system.

01:12:52.287 --> 01:12:59.366
Has been mostly represented by capitalists which makes a certain sense.

01:12:59.606 --> 01:13:13.076
And those capitalists with very few exceptions some but very few have fought against every effort to improve the lives of the mass of people.

01:13:13.172 --> 01:13:17.064
The goal of a capitalist is to minimize labor costs,

01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:25.247
what that means is replace a worker with a machine move the production from expensive u.s. to cheap China

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:40.668
bring in Desperate immigrants from other parts of the world because they will work for less money than the folks that you have here at home every measure to help the standard of living of American workers had to be fought for for

01:13:40.512 --> 01:13:46.070
decades over the opposition of capitalists from the beginning.

01:13:46.193 --> 01:13:58.843
To right now the reason we have a minimum wage which was passed 19 middle of the 1930s when it was proposed it was blocked by capitalists they got together they don't and today.

01:13:58.922 --> 01:14:01.292
Just a factoid for you.

01:14:01.911 --> 01:14:16.146
The last time the minimum wage was raised in United States federal minimum wage was in 2009 when it was set at the lofty some of $7.25 an hour.

01:14:16.377 --> 01:14:25.445
Which you cannot live on
over the last 12 years or so whatever it is now 11 12 13 years since then.

01:14:25.893 --> 01:14:32.332
We have had an increase in the price level in this country every year and in the last year eight and a half percent.

01:14:32.905 --> 01:14:38.769
During that time that the prices went up the minimum wage was never raised.

01:14:39.387 --> 01:14:47.510
What this is a time of stock market boom of growing inequality this is a sister you know.

01:14:49.848 --> 01:15:03.309
The nerve of the defender of capitalists who wants now to get credit for the Improvement in the standard of life of the workers that was fought by every generation.

01:15:03.405 --> 01:15:10.529
You know what takes your breath away and it's an argument whoa but I take my hat off if I had one.

01:15:10.670 --> 01:15:14.984
Because that is one of the only ways to justify this system.

01:15:15.306 --> 01:15:22.744
Long ago let me get it the heart of it long ago capitalism could have.

01:15:24.011 --> 01:15:31.045
Overcome hunger could have overcome disease could have be Way Beyond what we have now.

01:15:31.762 --> 01:15:40.344
But it didn't and that's the worst moral condemnation imagine how do you justify.

01:15:40.846 --> 01:15:49.580
That one you could you didn't look I let me get at it another way because just me may I interest you anyway.

01:15:50.514 --> 01:16:02.598
The issue is not that capitalism isn't technologically Dynamic it is and along the way it has developed things that have helped people's lives get better no.

01:16:02.694 --> 01:16:15.381
But the notion that the mass enjoyment of a rising standard of living is somehow built into capitalism is factually nuts and.

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:23.690
Is such an outrageous and I can give you a because you do math you'll understand it think of it this way.

01:16:23.795 --> 01:16:27.903
Imagine a production process in which you have.

01:16:28.333 --> 01:16:41.541
A hundred dollars that the capitalist has to lay out for tools equipment and raw materials and a hundred dollars that he has to lay out for workers hire the workers and he puts them all together and he has an output.

01:16:41.854 --> 01:16:51.525
And let's say the output is 100 units of something one of the prizes and that's his Revenue
and when he when he.

01:16:52.342 --> 01:17:00.960
Takes his product and sells it and gets the revenue let's say the revenue is it doesn't really matter it's 120

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:09.530
for lack of a better word any take 220 sorry and he takes 100 of it and replaces the tools equipment and raw materials he used up.

01:17:09.608 --> 01:17:19.162
Another 100 to hire the workers for the next shift and the other 20 is his prophet and he puts that aside now Along Comes A technological breakthrough.

01:17:19.943 --> 01:17:24.932
A machine a new machine and the new machine is so effective.

01:17:27.756 --> 01:17:37.004
You can get the same out the same number of units of output with half the workers so you don't need to spend a hundred on workers you only need to spend 50.

01:17:37.578 --> 01:17:46.421
You can do it with half the workers and so the capitalist goes to the workers by the way this happens every day and he says to half of them you're fired.

01:17:46.670 --> 01:17:52.426
Don't come back Monday morning I don't need you it's nothing personal it's just I got a machine

01:17:52.423 --> 01:18:01.590
why does he do that because of the 50 he now no longer has to spend on labor because don't need half of them he keeps

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:13.670
everything else is the same the machine everything else is does it just to make the math easy so he he keeps as his own profit the 50 that before he paid for those workers.

01:18:14.064 --> 01:18:21.998
Because when he sells it for 220 that 50 don't have to give to the next job we could get in the machine
so that's what he does.

01:18:22.391 --> 01:18:32.062
The technology leads he's happy he's become more profitable he's got an extra 50 which is why buys the machine.

01:18:32.609 --> 01:18:40.948
The workers are screwed half of them just lost their job have to go home to their husband and wife

01:18:40.747 --> 01:19:00.060
tell them I don't have a job anymore I didn't do anything wrong but the guy was nice enough to say he was not the wrong with me but he doesn't need them so I'm completely screwed here I don't know what I'm going to do about the decks we have the house on mortgage my children's education or whatever else is got going for himself right now

01:18:59.868 --> 01:19:03.804
now the point there was of course an alternative path.

01:19:04.261 --> 01:19:12.546
The alternative path would have been to keep all the workers pay them exactly the same that you did before for half a day's work.

01:19:13.650 --> 01:19:21.035
He would have got the same output same Revenue same profit as before.

01:19:21.131 --> 01:19:34.781
But the gain of the technology would have been a half a day of Freedom every day of the lives of these workers the majority of workers would have been really helped.

01:19:34.959 --> 01:19:36.618
By this technology.

01:19:37.056 --> 01:19:51.796
But instead they were screwed so that one guy the employer could make a big bundle of more money you want to support a system like this well I'm still go back to Hegel yes the good and the bad yes.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:20:00.932
So you just listed the bad and you also first listed the good to technological innovation of this kind of system the question is the alternative.

01:20:01.551 --> 01:20:11.466
Whatever as we try to sneak up to ideas of what the alternative might look like right what are the good and the bad of the alternative so you just kind of as a

01:20:11.319 --> 01:20:17.749
opposite the contract by contrast showed that while a nice alternative is you work less

01:20:17.728 --> 01:20:24.951
get paid the same you have more Leisure Time right opportunity to to pursue other.

01:20:25.263 --> 01:20:29.803
Interests other interest the creative interest family right,

01:20:29.827 --> 01:20:42.442
flourish as a human being basically strengthen and embolden the basic Humanity that's under all of us yes but then what cost does that have.

01:20:43.025 --> 01:20:45.206
On the,

01:20:45.266 --> 01:20:57.278
the deadline fueled competition fueled machine of technological innovation that is the positive side of capitalism slows it down

01:20:57.248 --> 01:21:05.785
it slows it down and the question is which is more important for the flourishing of humanity I love agree with that.

01:21:06.043 --> 01:21:12.519
And I love there to be a democratic mechanism so let's let's discuss it

01:21:12.372 --> 01:21:22.277
let's debate it and then let's ah decide what mixture cuz it's not either or the mapping problem I gave you is either or we could mix it you could have

01:21:22.266 --> 01:21:36.113
a third less of a working day instead of a half less and then the other part would be extra profit for our employer Etc today so let's have a democratic discussion of what is the mix between the positive and

01:21:36.012 --> 01:21:42.073
we have no such thing all of this is decided by one side in this debate which not only.

01:21:42.233 --> 01:21:50.076
We know what they do they always choose the one that maximizes their profit because that's what they were told to do in business school where I've taught,

01:21:50.083 --> 01:21:58.278
so we not only is it an undemocratic decision but it's lopsided to boot so we don't have the opportunity,

01:21:58.302 --> 01:22:08.216
but I would love for us to be good hug alien Marxist and say let's take a look at the plus and the minus and make the best decision that we can.

01:22:08.474 --> 01:22:15.877
We'll make mistakes but we'll all make them together it won't be one of us making a dictatorial decision

01:22:15.739 --> 01:22:24.483
you know marks developed the notion of the dictatorship of the proletariat not as the notion of how government is done I'm sorry not Marx Lenin did that

01:22:24.318 --> 01:22:30.820
not as an ocean of how our government works but as a notion of what the Practical reality is

01:22:30.755 --> 01:22:44.558
the dictatorship of needs key decisions is not made by some sitting Council it's made by each little capitalist in his her relationships with the workers in the workplace which is why marks focused has analysis

01:22:44.492 --> 01:22:45.683
on that point.

01:22:46.338 --> 01:22:55.432
By the way I can sketch for you right now so it doesn't look in the background what the alternative is let's go there okay it goes right back to what I said earlier.

01:22:55.592 --> 01:23:06.668
The workers of themselves the collection of employees together appropriate their own Surplus and decide

01:23:06.638 --> 01:23:14.382
democratically what to do with it which includes the decision of whether or not to buy a machine.

01:23:14.542 --> 01:23:22.026
And whether or not
to use the machine and the savings it might allow.

01:23:22.275 --> 01:23:30.407
To be handled by more Leisure for themselves or as a fund for new developments.

01:23:31.142 --> 01:23:42.857
In technology or new products or whatever they want and you know this this is an old idea in human marks love that towards the end of his life he.

01:23:43.529 --> 01:23:52.777
He started reading extensively in anthropology and one of the reasons he did that toward the end of his life was because he kept discovering.

01:23:53.027 --> 01:24:01.816
That in this Society in that one coming here in the United States that there were examples of people who organized.

01:24:01.957 --> 01:24:15.877
Their production in precisely this way as a collective Democratic community in which everybody had an equal voice so we all together decide democratically what to produce

01:24:15.802 --> 01:24:18.389
how to produce where to produce

01:24:18.323 --> 01:24:29.371
and what to do with the output we all helped to produce so let's do it in you know in this country where democracy is a.

01:24:29.882 --> 01:24:43.577
Valued nearly everybody subscribes to think about it this way the stunning contradiction that there is a place in our society where democracy has never been allowed to enter.

01:24:43.970 --> 01:24:51.400
The workplace in the workplace a tiny group of people unaccountable to the rest of them.

01:24:51.640 --> 01:25:00.114
The employer whether that's an individual a family a partnership or a corporate board of directors tiny group of people

01:25:00.066 --> 01:25:05.318
controls economically a vast mass of employees

01:25:05.081 --> 01:25:15.436
those employees don't elect those people have no clue nothing there is no accountability it is the most undemocratic mm an arrangement imaginable.

01:25:15.532 --> 01:25:28.732
And this Society insists on calling itself Democratic when it has organized the minor matter of producing everything in a in a way that is it the direct its autocratic

01:25:28.667 --> 01:25:41.606
so to push back a few things so one is the idea of this Society calling itself Democratic is that the government is elected democratically and the government is able to

01:25:41.567 --> 01:25:42.506
pressure

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:54.398
the workplace through the process of Regulation you pass laws of the boundaries of how you know minimum wage all those kinds of things that's the one idea the other is there is,

01:25:54.422 --> 01:26:04.282
natural force within the capitalist when there's no monopolies of competition being the accountability so if your shitty boss.

01:26:05.090 --> 01:26:18.263
The employer the employee in the capitalist system as the freedom to move to another company work for a better boss so that that creates pressure on the employers and the bosses that's at least the idea that you

01:26:18.215 --> 01:26:30.056
there's two boundaries of you not misbehaving one is the law of the regulatory regulations bypassed by the government Democratic and the second is

01:26:29.972 --> 01:26:37.807
because there's always Alternatives in theory then that puts pressure on everyone to behave well because you can always leave

01:26:37.768 --> 01:26:50.221
so I mean that's kinds of accountability but what you're saying is that does not result in any in a significant enough accountability or the employer.

01:26:50.515 --> 01:27:03.013
That avoids exploitation of the worker absolutely I mean whatever accountability you get in those mechanisms and let me respond to that and then on the counter argument.

01:27:03.136 --> 01:27:05.435
First competition.

01:27:06.323 --> 01:27:13.690
Here again we have to be Hague aliens just a little competition destroys itself.

01:27:14.038 --> 01:27:21.675
It doesn't need any out the whole point of competition is to beat the other guy if I can produce the same product as the other guy.

01:27:21.807 --> 01:27:28.796
Either a better quality or a lower price or maybe both then I win because the customers will come to me

01:27:28.667 --> 01:27:38.626
because my price is lower or my quality is better and they'll leave the other guy he'll go out of business now let's follow when he goes out of business because I won the competition

01:27:38.569 --> 01:27:41.390
he fires his workers.

01:27:41.891 --> 01:27:51.652
I hire them because I'm now going to be able to serve a market he can't serve anymore so I'm in I'm going to buy the used equipment I'm good and thereby many.

01:27:52.451 --> 01:28:02.086
Become fuel Monopoly is the product of competition it's not the antithesis it's the product

01:28:02.029 --> 01:28:11.287
well let's see that's what comes from where there's another there's another element to the system where there's always a new guy that comes in there isn't,

01:28:11.338 --> 01:28:15.850
there is one that's the that's the dream the entrepreneurial Spirit of a free.

01:28:16.055 --> 01:28:24.088
You know of the United States for example of a capitalist system is you can be,

01:28:24.148 --> 01:28:32.820
broke and one day have a strong idea build up a business that takes on Google and Facebook and Twitter and all the different.

01:28:33.222 --> 01:28:40.903
Car for GM which is what you know you look at Tesla for example right that's the American dream one of the many.

01:28:41.054 --> 01:28:47.304
Ideals of the American dream is you can move

01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:57.936
from dirt poor to being the richest person in the world but and it can happen it can happen but you're no that's like that's like you can win the lottery.

01:28:58.104 --> 01:29:06.524
No that's not quite know the lottery is complete luck here you can work your ass off if you have a Dodge a better in the lottery

01:29:06.368 --> 01:29:19.532
that's not that's not true there's a lot of new businesses how many Tesla's do you do you know just as a really bad example because the car company the automotive sector is so difficult,

01:29:20.061 --> 01:29:33.648
to the operator such a thin margin of profit they're probably a good example of like capitalism just completely coming to a halt in terms of lack of innovation because you know

01:29:33.438 --> 01:29:42.146
that's a very complicated industry because of the supply chain it all so much come on they have their uniqueness as you're quite right.

01:29:42.233 --> 01:29:50.284
But so does every other industry the one thing that's common is that many become few what you can also have is when you have a few

01:29:50.255 --> 01:29:58.800
they jack up the price they make an enormous profit and in the irony of capitalism Marx would love this they begin to.

01:29:58.987 --> 01:30:11.386
Incentivize people to break into this industry because the few remaining are making a wild amount of profit because they are a few and can trigger the market to make it work like that for them

01:30:11.284 --> 01:30:17.543
so the reason every mm every small capitalist is trying to

01:30:17.315 --> 01:30:33.378
build market share that's a polite way polite way of saying they want to become a monopolist or to be more exact and oligopolist one of the handful of firms that dominate that's what they're there for but yeah to push back a little bit also because that's,

01:30:33.384 --> 01:30:42.443
could be this is a question also do you think we're in danger of oversimplifying capitalism the completed removes

01:30:42.369 --> 01:30:51.373
the basic decency of human beings so if you give me a choice to press the press a button,

01:30:51.380 --> 01:31:04.607
to get rid of the competition and that but that's going to lead to a lot of suffering there's a lot of people at the heads of companies that won't press that button that it's not in the calculation is not just money

01:31:04.505 --> 01:31:08.694
it's human well-being to so like the think.

01:31:08.781 --> 01:31:19.532
I yes every intern who and I don't live in the same place that so you're saying that the forces of capitalism Takeover in the minds of the people at the top you got,

01:31:19.584 --> 01:31:22.306
and then did during they cease Being Human

01:31:22.294 --> 01:31:37.204
this is the basic I wouldn't I would have any in your model of humans they lose track of the better angels of their nature and they just become cogs in the machine but there just happened to be the cop I would put it differently that

01:31:37.111 --> 01:31:40.940
the system is so set up it's a little bit like natural selection

01:31:40.811 --> 01:31:50.780
the guys who may own I could say the women to doesn't matter the people who make it up through the layers of the bureaucracy and get to the top in these things,

01:31:50.786 --> 01:32:00.043
have had to do things along the way that becomes selective if they can't stand it because they have that human quality and they are people I had known them.

01:32:00.616 --> 01:32:04.076
They're the ones running an air B&B in Vermont.

01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:17.813
They checked they went there and they said I'm not doing this anymore I'm not going to treat people like that I'm gonna make a lovely place in Vermont with my husband or my wife or whatever and I'm going to be you know enjoy of the people that come by and,

01:32:17.883 --> 01:32:22.764
be a decent amount of course of course but the system selects.

01:32:23.275 --> 01:32:27.977
The Firm you know if you don't do what has to be done to make the profit go up

01:32:27.884 --> 01:32:36.430
you're toast there anyway there the rest of the people who vote for you are going to kick you out you can tell them I'm all day long what a lovely person you are,

01:32:36.490 --> 01:32:47.061
they're going to look at you and wonder what happened to you how did you even get this far with the lovely person horse that's not okay it's not necessarily just lovely person so maybe.

01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:58.701
My I'll just say my bias is the people I know are especially at the top of companies are in the tech sector but where innovation.

01:32:59.194 --> 01:33:09.658
Is such a big part of it so I think a lot of the things we're talking about is when there's not much innovation in the system.

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:10.558
So

01:33:10.834 --> 01:33:21.351
Innovation usually comes in the history of capitalism Innovation comes in spurts there's the electric period that chemistry period the nuclear period there's now,

01:33:21.385 --> 01:33:32.883
whatever you want to call it the artificial intelligence or robotics or computer it doesn't it comes and then there's a flurry as everything is reorganized around whatever the newest,

01:33:32.899 --> 01:33:34.692
technology is,

01:33:34.753 --> 01:33:47.332
and then you have a period where you can get excited about that and the very rich people come to the top can talk endlessly as they always do about Innovation but again you know it really is

01:33:47.212 --> 01:33:55.641
this is a recurring kind of debate and a recurring kind of issue for me.

01:33:56.169 --> 01:33:59.881
How do I put this in a way that.

01:34:00.292 --> 01:34:07.443
No I don't mean to offend so I think please please no no no I don't I don't want to but.

01:34:11.716 --> 01:34:25.907
The problem with capitalism is and maybe you'll like this the problem of capitalism is not that it is the one thing that's consistent with human nature that's what its Defenders would like to have us believe,

01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:28.968
but if anything I would argue the opposite

01:34:28.965 --> 01:34:36.223
that it is such a contradiction two parts of our nature not other parts.

01:34:36.392 --> 01:34:43.776
That there it can never quite make it there's always going to be the people who don't go along with it,

01:34:43.782 --> 01:34:55.893
people you're talking about who do quit along the way or maybe a few of them actually make it to the top by God knows what hook or what crook that they did it.

01:34:55.990 --> 01:35:05.372
Most of them go and you know why because their humanity is contradicted by what it is they're being asked.

01:35:05.676 --> 01:35:10.819
To do I mean the corporate sector this year just to give you an idea.

01:35:11.455 --> 01:35:16.158
CEOs are jacking up there.

01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:25.286
Their wage package they're already out of whack I mean the average CEO pay is now 33 hundred times what the average worker pay is.

01:35:25.445 --> 01:35:30.318
But they're jacking it up even more why because that's what's happening in their universe that's,

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:44.973
they're all doing it and they have to do each one of them justifies that I have to do though was I'd lose my guide in the next one which of course it's true but is no comfort for the mass of people who aren't CEOs for whom this argument is very exciting so.

01:35:45.223 --> 01:35:54.219
There are they're doing that at a time when the American people can't cope they've just gone through the covid disaster.

01:35:54.657 --> 01:36:04.536
They've gone through the worst second worst economic crash of capitalism in our history after two years of this one two punch they got an inflation.

01:36:05.019 --> 01:36:18.156
Third punch and we are now predicting Rising interest rates in a recession at the end of the year or early next year you can't do this to a working-class when this was done to the German working-class in the 1920s,

01:36:18.216 --> 01:36:25.637
Hitler was the result you keep doing that in this country were already watching it you're going to get that too.

01:36:25.715 --> 01:36:37.321
You're ready getting bits and pieces you can't this is a quiet suffering amidst the wrong class that's growing taking out on it can turn to anger some little 18 year old kid who has to go

01:36:37.292 --> 01:36:46.513
three hours in his car and blow away people in a supermarket why it happens every day in this country every day.

01:36:46.897 --> 01:36:56.155
So the that anger Rises up in those little ways now and bigger things just like actually by the way there's one more thing.

01:36:56.764 --> 01:37:04.869
On the rationality and this goes to Elon Musk
if you're interested

01:37:04.776 --> 01:37:13.196
49,000 people were killed in automobile accidents this last year number was just released yesterday 49,000

01:37:13.094 --> 01:37:25.178
automobiles are the single largest pollutant in the country they use up an enormous amount of energy they they use up at Norma's on our resources.

01:37:25.481 --> 01:37:27.833
There is a way

01:37:27.732 --> 01:37:37.313
to make Transportation much more rational and we've known it for decades it's called mass transportation it's a really

01:37:37.184 --> 01:37:50.889
beautifully maintained Crystal Clear clean frequent system of buses trains street rod trolleys Vans it could easily be done in this Society.

01:37:52.119 --> 01:38:01.709
In fact I once did a project that is estimated cost 30 billion dollars that's less than we're sending to Ukraine to do this to reconfigure it.

01:38:01.796 --> 01:38:12.287
The public transit system where everywhere this country all the major measurable this country's overwhelmingly metropolitan area well if you are really has to be more than 30 billion good,

01:38:12.347 --> 01:38:26.123
but was a few years ago Cheryl you're saying it but I'm using a lot of it's insane right it's not crazy stuff it's a reasonable number I right but there's a let me just finish the pointer yes okay so.

01:38:27.066 --> 01:38:34.477
I'm trying to be rational here
if we have a climate crisis which everyone tells me we do

01:38:34.358 --> 01:38:46.297
if it's got a lot to do with fossil fuels which everybody tells me he has to do and with the use of the fossil fuel particularly for the automobile then the solution to the problem would be mass transit

01:38:46.295 --> 01:38:53.454
we don't we're doing nothing to make that happen nothing well there's you know on,

01:38:53.523 --> 01:39:00.953
You could argue that autonomous vehicles is a kind of public transit because it's going to be reusable Vehicles it will end,

01:39:00.977 --> 01:39:14.907
in theory car ownership so you just have a more kind of distributed public transit if it happens but you know that that's a side effect his major goal and the major goal of the other companies that are busy

01:39:14.706 --> 01:39:24.332
squeezing to get his share of the pie smaller so they have some for General Motors Toyota all of them are making electric cars though so

01:39:24.329 --> 01:39:30.859
what they've done is they've replaced the individual car with fossil fuel with another individual car.

01:39:31.450 --> 01:39:45.991
That's fucking nuts what are you doing what at one of the things they're doing but automation is also nothing but on the Elan side there's also hilariously named boring company yes which is working on tunnels which is actually expanding the.

01:39:46.196 --> 01:39:49.358
He's the the flexibility you might have

01:39:49.229 --> 01:39:58.162
to start playing with ideas of public transit I think listen I'm now partially living in Austin Texas that I don't know if they know

01:39:58.070 --> 01:40:07.300
what a public transit system is period yes there's a most of American constructs yeah they're well there's this is an interesting so.

01:40:07.549 --> 01:40:16.968
The older that by the way footnote the older this city the more likely it has public transportation so you're saying Boston is the best example yes,

01:40:17.001 --> 01:40:25.259
have you been able yeah of course you have a place in Boston with the street Railway Boston is your case study of how to do this

01:40:25.238 --> 01:40:35.639
because they've been doing it all along New York's pretty good too there's a Trader yeah New York I would say is better than Boston because there's their technology also helps you out

01:40:35.492 --> 01:40:43.633
to do the public transit better so it's almost like Boston's a little too old but yes I get your point but there is a.

01:40:44.422 --> 01:40:54.093
The the Ford F-150 pickup truck symbolizes something about America and there is a practical nature to the fact

01:40:53.902 --> 01:40:56.965
in order to do public transit in order to

01:40:56.782 --> 01:41:11.080
do some of these things that you're talking about with the working-class there has to be a central planning component or there has to be a centralized component and America is very much.

01:41:11.375 --> 01:41:13.386
Based on the idea of.

01:41:13.554 --> 01:41:22.847
At least in recent times while see from the founding of individualism of respecting individual Freedom are you worried that.

01:41:23.186 --> 01:41:31.480
In order to bring some of these ideas of Marxism to life you would trample on individual freedoms.

01:41:32.206 --> 01:41:36.269
For me both sure for me Marxism is

01:41:36.176 --> 01:41:47.441
a way to enhance the individual freedom of the mass of people who have had that freedom eroded under the capitalist oh that's a motive for my Marxism.

01:41:47.537 --> 01:42:01.124
It was for Mark's to heal of the French Revolution he loved the liberte egalite a fraternity the great three and then democracy the American contribution if you like he believed in all of that,

01:42:01.149 --> 01:42:04.572
his critique of capitalism was it promised it.

01:42:05.011 --> 01:42:11.864
And then never delivered it and the reason you have to go beyond it is because it didn't deliver what it had.

01:42:12.194 --> 01:42:18.157
Promise of for me it is the Fulfillment of.

01:42:18.721 --> 01:42:24.035
Of a genuine but again I'm a galleon marks so if you want.

01:42:24.798 --> 01:42:32.704
Individualism for me is not the way it's set up in this Society some sort of antithesis.

01:42:33.332 --> 01:42:42.499
To the government I think an immense Khan has been pulled on the American people and the con works like this.

01:42:43.324 --> 01:42:46.100
You know what's bad and what's dangerous and threatens you.

01:42:46.349 --> 01:42:58.748
It's the government the government is going to come in and tell you what to do the government's going to run your life the government's the problem there really is no other way to explain the following in American politics.

01:42:59.024 --> 01:43:06.139
Large numbers of people lose their homes in a downturn like the so-called Great Recession of 2008.

01:43:06.469 --> 01:43:14.592
Who do they blame the government large numbers of people go unemployed and what is the media all about the government.

01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:24.720
If I were a capitalist I'd love this I kicked the workers by throwing them out of their home and they don't get angry with me beginning with the government.

01:43:25.077 --> 01:43:33.793
Fire large numbers of people I have no responsibility for what happens to them as a result of having no job and no income and they get angry at the senator.

01:43:34.304 --> 01:43:43.048
I'm laughing all the way to the bank this is a genius stroke in theory but there is if you look at government.

01:43:43.198 --> 01:43:53.428
Because you said accountability in the capitalist system has no accountability there's some pushback I gave on the accountability I think there's some accountability we can discuss in a hegelian wait who.

01:43:53.515 --> 01:43:59.774
There's more accountability for I would say that in theory government is

01:43:59.726 --> 01:44:09.479
perfectly accountable as the whole point of a democratic system is you vote people in English practice right there's a giant growing bureaucracy

01:44:09.458 --> 01:44:14.124
that is accountable only on the surface there's two parties.

01:44:14.301 --> 01:44:27.609
That Seymour the same are the same media somehow integrated into making the the same two parties as just wearing different colored shirts or to seem like they're very,

01:44:27.652 --> 01:44:37.142
opposed in are arguing and bitterly arguing the calling each other's as far as nice nasty names and all those kinds of things okay but that's government.

01:44:37.653 --> 01:44:46.145
So what exactly is worst I had government or companies why are we asking that question.

01:44:46.376 --> 01:44:53.301
These are the twins look what you were what you were able to say about Republicans and Democrats just out with which I agree.

01:44:53.659 --> 01:45:01.179
I would say the same thing about corporations and the government this is the same people literally let's go to Churchill which one is the

01:45:01.095 --> 01:45:09.956
which one is course let's go to church or like democracy is the worst form of government except all the other ones or whatever so this kind of same idea

01:45:09.944 --> 01:45:20.362
which one exactly is worse because to me it seems like which one between what a government and Industry and companies it's because government.

01:45:20.459 --> 01:45:27.744
Plagued by I will call it corruption because the corruption of.

01:45:27.985 --> 01:45:36.440
Bureaucratic paperwork and then because it but they're not account there doesn't seem to be a serious accountability again.

01:45:36.744 --> 01:45:45.163
Will not see we're not living on the same Planet the greatest practitioners of central planning our corporations.

01:45:46.124 --> 01:45:53.662
Ilan has an operation like General Motors Ford IBM or any of the other Mega corpse.

01:45:53.848 --> 01:45:58.190
They have to plan they buy up companies

01:45:58.115 --> 01:46:11.100
because they don't want to deal with in the market they don't want the insecurity the uncertainty of having to buy their inputs or sell their outputs to somebody they don't control.

01:46:11.331 --> 01:46:15.843
They want the professor to teach the genius of a market they hate

01:46:15.670 --> 01:46:28.932
the market and when they grow to be big they keep buying whoever they were dealing with before so they could better control them which requires them then to plan the production and distribution of goods

01:46:28.795 --> 01:46:32.362
inside rather than buying them in the market.

01:46:33.008 --> 01:46:42.319
The model of the government is it a private Corporation I have spent my life give you an example in American universities.

01:46:42.442 --> 01:46:56.120
Big ones famous were not just as a student but as a professor I have a dozen school I teach now at the new school here is another one right they will model themselves after businesses they model the.

01:46:56.189 --> 01:47:05.698
You can attack the bureaucracy of universities good reason that mess but they're proudly modeling themselves

01:47:05.605 --> 01:47:18.022
on organizing their bill bureaucracy in a businesslike manner uh-huh so you're looking at a difference which isn't there the government and the private sector

01:47:17.974 --> 01:47:24.422
our partners and both of them wouldn't have it any other way the corporations want that

01:47:24.276 --> 01:47:38.737
from the government and the government now knows that the please the corporation's is the number-one objective they have because that's how they keep their jobs and keep their system going and so for all practical purposes

01:47:38.608 --> 01:47:44.840
this is this is the same people but there's a important differences that

01:47:44.756 --> 01:47:56.336
I don't know if they're fundamental or just consequence of history but if you have government they're accountable in a different way than companies companies are accountable by especially if you have a

01:47:56.243 --> 01:48:08.191
consumer they're accountable by sort of consumer spending or not spending their money on whatever the heck the company is selling the government is accountable by votes

01:48:08.135 --> 01:48:15.582
and it seems like government unlike companies for most of companies history.

01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:25.962
Is always too big to fail meaning it can always just print money it can always save itself and that creates a bureaucracy you never.

01:48:26.068 --> 01:48:34.110
You rarely pay the cost of having made bad decisions if you're in government you distribute the blame.

01:48:34.692 --> 01:48:44.489
And it's very unclear who's responsible for bad decisions so bad decisions and government accumulate so you become more and more and more inefficient and.

01:48:44.612 --> 01:48:59.109
More and more poor in your decision-making terms of you said public transit should we build a public transit system in this city or not that's a difficult decision that's an interesting decision I would say it's very often very good decision.

01:48:59.286 --> 01:49:08.759
But whoever makes that decision should be accountable for a good or bad decision and it seems like companies are more accountable they pay,

01:49:08.774 --> 01:49:11.127
they feel the pain

01:49:11.106 --> 01:49:25.683
of having made a bad decision more because it can go bankrupt they I mean there's much more day-to-day pressure to make good engineering decisions government doesn't seem to be under the same level of pressure.

01:49:25.951 --> 01:49:31.166
Is do you disagree with that I disagree with everything in my history.

01:49:31.352 --> 01:49:43.328
Pushes me you may be living I may be living a different who knows a planet or taking a different sort of drug I won't I won't mention the name but.

01:49:43.964 --> 01:49:52.834
I personally had a lot to do with a very large company here in the United States here in the New York area and.

01:49:55.694 --> 01:50:05.194
It involved two brothers and a family who built it up into a huge corporation one of the brothers was.

01:50:06.119 --> 01:50:09.731
Kind of the Dynamo
of the family.

01:50:10.044 --> 01:50:19.976
And he was more responsible anybody else building it up
but he took care of his brothers he had a nice feeling about his brother so the one brother who could not.

01:50:20.567 --> 01:50:26.080
You know without help tie his shoes became a vice president.

01:50:26.221 --> 01:50:37.341
Got an enormous salary got a beautiful office in a skyscraper not that many blocks from where I'm sitting right now and.

01:50:37.519 --> 01:50:42.167
That was the way that family handle that company.

01:50:42.452 --> 01:50:50.610
And all of his relatives that were somewhere in this company doing a variety of whatever because.

01:50:50.716 --> 01:50:53.456
And my experience with this.

01:50:54.056 --> 01:51:03.808
And because I went to the school's I told you all my experiences with that group of people corporate has a full of those stories you know.

01:51:04.715 --> 01:51:12.108
They made mistake after mistake which they were told you what didn't-didn't undermined there they were always able

01:51:12.024 --> 01:51:25.080
to blame somebody else something else that's great them through and had they not been able to they would have been replaced by another person who did the same thing for as long as they could.

01:51:25.528 --> 01:51:31.121
And they knew it they would talk about it at family of that's how I know.

01:51:31.604 --> 01:51:37.224
Yeah that's I mean I understand that you want the outside world to look at it this way but.

01:51:37.474 --> 01:51:47.190
Well my experience interest but again what's that kind of thing the risk of saying human nature again I wonder what.

01:51:47.628 --> 01:51:49.675
Kind of system,

01:51:49.717 --> 01:51:58.848
alas for that more versus versus less this is the question of the I will call that let's put that under the umbrella term of corruption

01:51:58.836 --> 01:52:12.027
which system allows for more corruption remember that the way I defined the different system is not more or less government it's more or less allowing a democratic workplace yeah reconfiguring it what what happens,

01:52:12.051 --> 01:52:17.420
when everybody
Matt has a vote when you have to explain.

01:52:17.741 --> 01:52:29.680
What the strategies are what the alternatives are to a larger number of people than a board of directors or a major shareholders or whoever it is that most companies are responsible to

01:52:29.453 --> 01:52:38.944
and now you've got a whole different Universe it's not a small group of people can't be hidden the way it's normally hidden most of it and on and on and on

01:52:38.725 --> 01:52:47.982
this is you know worker coops is what this is called in many parts of the world so it's not that I'm advocating something that's never been seen before not at all

01:52:47.809 --> 01:52:51.475
the Marxism I understand is too,

01:52:51.517 --> 01:52:57.893
pick from historical precedence the things that we think will work

01:52:57.864 --> 01:53:12.612
better and I think if all the people in an Enterprise just to drive the point home democratically decided they would never give two or three individuals a hundred million dollars while everybody else can send their kids to college a that can do that

01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:17.510
so just to return this to address this.

01:53:17.831 --> 01:53:25.999
Point about the particular implementation of Marxism that was the early days but in the Soviet Union why did.

01:53:26.212 --> 01:53:35.721
Stalinism for example lead to so much Bloodshed do you think and human suffering is there any elements within the ideas of Marxism.

01:53:35.845 --> 01:53:37.963
That catalyzed.

01:53:39.301 --> 01:53:46.272
The kind of government the kind of system that led to that bloodshed.

01:53:46.359 --> 01:53:54.716
I don't think so I think there are many things that led to the Bloodshed and so all that Stalin's regimes did and.

01:53:54.992 --> 01:54:02.692
You know I spent 10 years of my life with another Economist writing a book

01:54:02.572 --> 01:54:13.459
about that to try to explain from a Marxist position the rise and fall of the Soviet Union you mean you might want to take a look at it sometime but

01:54:13.348 --> 01:54:20.984
there I'm going to say a few things now but all of those things are spelled out in great detail with loads of empirical,

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:30.617
evidence at cetera in that in that work let me start with you know playing a little bit with with Hegel.

01:54:32.244 --> 01:54:36.450
The biggest impact that Marxism had

01:54:36.448 --> 01:54:44.499
on the Soviet Union was really not so much what the Soviet Union did but what the rest of the world did,

01:54:44.523 --> 01:54:53.537
you had a really interesting move and I'll give you a parallel sometime today the move was.

01:54:54.587 --> 01:55:03.313
That the old Russian regime collapsed World War 1 just it fell apart there's our and all of that

01:55:03.230 --> 01:55:15.763
it couldn't it couldn't survive it already been in trouble there was a revolution 1905 there was the loss of the war to Japan and then if you know Russian history which I assume you do

01:55:15.617 --> 01:55:22.218
you'll know that there was a lot leading up to the collapse in 1917

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:26.512
and in some ways it was fortuitous that the.

01:55:26.663 --> 01:55:34.587
Political group very small that could seize the opportunity of that collapse happened to be marxists.

01:55:34.675 --> 01:55:39.790
You know earlier on with kerensky the first government that tried

01:55:39.761 --> 01:55:51.188
it wasn't people all that impressed by Marxism label people more skeptical and would not have been called Marxist probably in by history they couldn't they try

01:55:51.077 --> 01:55:58.515
they couldn't Lenin and his associates the were able to take over from them later in that same year.

01:55:59.089 --> 01:56:01.198
The rest of the world though was horrified.

01:56:01.753 --> 01:56:11.613
The rest of the world saw Marxism having taken this immense leap from being a political party of movement.

01:56:11.908 --> 01:56:20.877
Critical of capitalism yes but still not challenging the power now it had the power and in a big country.

01:56:21.297 --> 01:56:22.507
And they freaked out.

01:56:23.368 --> 01:56:31.400
If you know American history this country the leadership of this country went completely berserk I mean we had

01:56:31.353 --> 01:56:44.832
repression of the left the likes of which we had not seen before sat the 20s were a time of Palmer Raids in Boston the sacko Vanzetti trials and he really

01:56:44.811 --> 01:56:54.491
Grim hostility and you had the four countries agreeing to invade the Soviet Union to try to crush the revolution the US.

01:56:54.885 --> 01:56:59.973
Britain France and Japan all attacked 10,000 American troops.

01:57:00.079 --> 01:57:06.258
So what you had right away was an ocean in the west that this was.

01:57:06.624 --> 01:57:14.090
This was Unthinkable this one there was a great professor at Princeton Meyer forget his first name.

01:57:14.186 --> 01:57:22.713
Who wrote his wonderful book about all American foreign policy since 1917 has been obsessed,

01:57:22.738 --> 01:57:33.651
with Russia even now this this fight with Ukraine is half about Russia as if Russia still was the Soviet Union as if people haven't figured out.

01:57:33.865 --> 01:57:41.033
That was a big change back in a 1989 and 90 you know Yeltsin and and Putin are not what

01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:49.576
what you had before or at least they're not Lennon they may not be so different from some of the other but I case.

01:57:49.655 --> 01:57:55.724
So you have one factor was the utter isolation the utter,

01:57:55.758 --> 01:58:05.907
condemnation the global I mean Rosa Luxemburg is I mean I assume you know the in Rosa Luxemburg is hunted down in the streets,

01:58:05.976 --> 01:58:12.658
Berlin she's a critical blendin's by the way but she's a leftist hunted down and hacked into bits.

01:58:12.817 --> 01:58:21.903
Killed see you are attributing some he's around some of the Bloodshed to the fact that basically the rest of the world turned away.

01:58:22.243 --> 01:58:34.579
Turned against not turn against so you turn to guess is the butter with very yeah I mean not in order of importance but it's it's a very important part of the psychology of being you know.

01:58:35.809 --> 01:58:48.208
It's what you would call paranoid if they weren't quite as much evidence that they did there was a lot to be afraid of at that time nobody had ever done it look you could see the effects of it by Stalin inventing the idea

01:58:48.142 --> 01:58:57.381
which had no support at first that you could have socialism in one country that was thought to be ridiculous that socialism was

01:58:57.316 --> 01:59:09.192
internationalism Marx was it Marx was against capitalism everywhere it was you know workers of the World Unite not workers of Russia unite where workers of the

01:59:09.163 --> 01:59:16.340
he had to go through a procedure of kind of coming to terms with the fact that the

01:59:16.274 --> 01:59:26.477
Revolution he had in Russia which was tried in Berlin was tried in Munich was tried in Budapest was tried in Seattle here they all failed

01:59:26.465 --> 01:59:35.380
they all fit and he's left so the French would say dude cell right here all alone that's one.

01:59:35.917 --> 01:59:42.348
The second thing is economic isolation Russia is a poor country and it needed.

01:59:42.723 --> 01:59:56.112
What he got before the war which were heavy investments from the French and the Germans particularly but others too now this was all cut off and you can see the replay with the sanctions programs it's weird too.

01:59:56.244 --> 02:00:02.540
We're gonna do it again we're gonna do it again we have to do we we had the world is different and the sanctions don't work but.

02:00:02.861 --> 02:00:12.406
They're going to trial to try because it's the history but that culture was its today is completely different Russia's a different place today,

02:00:12.412 --> 02:00:23.965
but Russia has China and that changes everything and they don't get that here yet but they will yeah there's a very complicated Dynamic with China even it with India yep but.

02:00:24.133 --> 02:00:26.242
Porter's sorry Jill

02:00:26.159 --> 02:00:36.569
yeah sorry to say human nature may change at a slower Pace yes the the does job has occurred to me as well so is there a

02:00:36.503 --> 02:00:43.671
Can you steal man the case or consider the case that there's something about the implementation of Marxism

02:00:43.524 --> 02:00:52.890
maybe because of the idealistic nature of focusing on the working class and Workers Unite then naturally,

02:00:52.905 --> 02:01:00.064
leads to formation of a dictatorial force a dictator that says let us temporarily.

02:01:00.674 --> 02:01:08.157
Give power to this person to manage some of the details of how to run the democracy.

02:01:08.335 --> 02:01:17.582
Of giving voice to the workers so they get to choose and then that naturally leads to a dictator and there's naturally in human nature.

02:01:17.868 --> 02:01:27.467
The power and absolute power as the old adage goes corrupts absolutely is it possible that whenever you focus on Marxist ideals.

02:01:27.698 --> 02:01:36.956
You're going to end up with a dictator and often when you give too much power to anyone human or small number of people you're going to get into huge amount of trouble.

02:01:37.655 --> 02:01:43.068
You pushed things together there that I would separate I think if you if you give,

02:01:43.074 --> 02:01:54.033
pushed as a dish to yeah German the if you remember I told you my mother was born in Germany and and then new dad is French.

02:01:54.129 --> 02:02:05.655
Yeah but he was born in Mets if you know George European it's a city on the border of France and Germany if you come from the other aisle stations I was a student in German

02:02:05.652 --> 02:02:08.112
so they're german-speaking fashionable

02:02:08.029 --> 02:02:18.654
it's a bilingual because it's been back and forth so many times in medieval days already that it literally go from one store to another the proprietor here

02:02:18.507 --> 02:02:24.802
is French in the proprietor there is German but they all speak both languages because

02:02:24.656 --> 02:02:34.597
you don't speak either of them I speak Russian Russian but not dramatically crania node you I it took French for four years in high school but I forgotten all of it

02:02:34.486 --> 02:02:42.897
I I remember the romance and the spirit of the language but not the details I'm sure I can remember if you allocate power.

02:02:43.777 --> 02:02:50.558
Unequally undemocratic lie and you do it for a very long period of time.

02:02:51.113 --> 02:02:57.517
And you do it on Monday many levels of ideology it is not surprising

02:02:57.424 --> 02:03:10.408
that it sticks and it stays and you can make a political revolution or even an economic Revolution and you will Discover it has a life of its own and it's going to take a long time

02:03:10.369 --> 02:03:17.691
before people don't if you have a religious tradition Christianity that Prides itself on its

02:03:17.679 --> 02:03:30.285
monotheism and that it doesn't want to have anything to do with the old Greek mythology when there was Zeus and Diana and all the others and they were very human-like but instead we have one.

02:03:30.363 --> 02:03:36.073
Who is the absolute beginning in a yo what are you doing you're teaching people.

02:03:37.097 --> 02:03:46.831
An authority line that comes from the individual if you have a sequence of Kings if in your feudal manner the Lord sits.

02:03:46.937 --> 02:03:52.287
Call the landline he has unspeakable power over everything that goes on.

02:03:52.428 --> 02:04:07.113
And you do this for thousands of years you can make a Russian Revolution in 1917 but if you imagine you've gotten away from all that people assume without ever thinking about it you're going to have trouble,

02:04:07.156 --> 02:04:11.669
Stalin is figured here.

02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:21.472
As the originator of his situation he wasn't he didn't never had that power he may have thought that but I don't he's the product.

02:04:21.937 --> 02:04:26.567
Look the Cuban people made Fidel who really wasn't that kind of guy.

02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:36.335
He's a baseball playing lawyer that's what he was but they made him into Colossus not it's not the product of History,

02:04:36.341 --> 02:04:46.084
no no it's it was the system's feudalism the judicature it was the structures and institutions that cultivated in people

02:04:45.856 --> 02:05:00.236
a mentality that has its own Rhythm and doesn't take doesn't follow the calendar of a political revolution that's the fundamental question is there something about communism that creates them and mentality that.

02:05:01.592 --> 02:05:04.926
Enables somebody like Stalin or mile.

02:05:05.148 --> 02:05:18.294
I think it's the social issues and problems that Society has that make them then go to what they find familiar to what seems to make sense and he's the guy look let me give you an example from American history.

02:05:18.634 --> 02:05:25.712
The Republican party has traditionally in this country been the party of private Enterprise and minimum government.

02:05:25.997 --> 02:05:31.653
Incomes Trump runs for office in 2016 is elected.

02:05:31.921 --> 02:05:45.814
Okay what does he do he commences the most massive tax increase and the most massive government intervention in the worlds of of Economics that we have had for deck,

02:05:45.865 --> 02:05:53.565
nobody says anything the Republicans gave and the Democrats largely too.

02:05:54.031 --> 02:05:56.392
The cave he can he can.

02:05:56.821 --> 02:06:04.179
He can throw a tariff on anything he gets up in front of the American people and he says the Chinese will pay the Tariff.

02:06:04.293 --> 02:06:16.611
That's not what a tariff is somehow a tariff Works he would flunk a quarter a freshman course in economics which everybody knows everybody who teaches these courses no it doesn't matter.

02:06:17.031 --> 02:06:19.015
He still calling the shots,

02:06:19.039 --> 02:06:31.212
what is going on here is that a society has come to a point where it can't solve its problems and it begins what to tap into older

02:06:31.192 --> 02:06:37.523
forms and all of the less a fair and all of the individualism

02:06:37.439 --> 02:06:49.487
fumbling and suddenly the Republican party is going on now they're going to make abortion illegal the government is telling you what you can do with your uterus.

02:06:49.566 --> 02:06:50.469
What.

02:06:50.601 --> 02:07:01.298
What the government is being given more and more and more and more power they're hoping what do they like the government no too desperate.

02:07:01.368 --> 02:07:11.966
This is not a pro-government and it wasn't in Russia Island they were in a desperate fix and so and he took advantage.

02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:14.316
To which degree did.

02:07:14.673 --> 02:07:22.580
Would you say Market Marx's ideas led to the creation of the,

02:07:22.622 --> 02:07:32.878
national socialism party of German Workers has the Nazi party the fascist party in the 30s and the 40s

02:07:32.740 --> 02:07:37.866
at the head of on was Hitler which I just recently learned he was.

02:07:38.259 --> 02:07:43.789
Employee number 7 of the party or whatever the seventh person to have joined the party,

02:07:43.804 --> 02:07:54.132
and have created one of the most consequential and Powerful political parties in the history of the 20th century what degree did marks

02:07:53.986 --> 02:08:02.676
ideas Marxism ideas have to play it is the National Socialist Party of German Workers right.

02:08:02.754 --> 02:08:10.282
Workers not so this this is such that Nazi analysis anesthesia Deutsche arbeiterpartei

02:08:10.199 --> 02:08:15.864
German worker party worker party National Socialist German Workers Party

02:08:15.807 --> 02:08:25.407
so but here's the history and they care about the person that did you just use the workers as a populist message the only thing that Marxism.

02:08:25.485 --> 02:08:28.999
Did for mr. Hitler was provide him

02:08:28.897 --> 02:08:39.927
with his stepping stone to power but had nothing no other he didn't know anything about it didn't care anything about nor did the people around him here's the story of what happened there which I know

02:08:39.699 --> 02:08:45.220
largely through my own family and plus my own history the work that I did.

02:08:45.506 --> 02:08:49.802
The most successful socialist party in Europe was the German party

02:08:49.800 --> 02:09:00.569
it started around 1870 marks that was still alive some of his own family were leaders fed nonetheless Alan other's daughters.

02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:12.335
By the end of the century it was the second most important party in Germany nobody understood it it was over what it was almost as big a shock to the Europeans.

02:09:12.414 --> 02:09:21.553
As was the Russian Revolution in 1917 here was a political party that was now in every German City in every German Town

02:09:21.416 --> 02:09:31.249
powerful and enjoying its rise up that's my family's involved in this Sunday I really do know the story

02:09:31.138 --> 02:09:37.244
it meant that starting around 19 6 7 8.

02:09:37.656 --> 02:09:41.368
If you wanted to have any kind.

02:09:41.797 --> 02:09:50.541
Of presence in the German working-class you had to use the word socialist yeah to otherwise they wouldn't pay attention.

02:09:50.646 --> 02:09:58.814
The other part is called themselves Catholic that Germany is divided the upper tooth the northern two-thirds is Protestant

02:09:58.685 --> 02:10:09.869
the southern third is Catholic Munich and Bavaria is Catholic and every other part of Germany basically he's promised you could be in the Catholic party that was the South

02:10:09.749 --> 02:10:13.190
or you could be in various conservative.

02:10:13.449 --> 02:10:21.193
Prussian and other body but if you wanted to have a presence in the working class which was growing everyone in Germany very powerful

02:10:21.092 --> 02:10:28.918
capitalist country expanding like crazy at this time you know Germany was the major competitor to Britain for the empire

02:10:28.735 --> 02:10:36.237
the United States was was coming up to but it was Germany and u.s. taking over from Britain's Empire

02:10:36.117 --> 02:10:42.673
so the German working class was it so anybody who wanted to approach.

02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:50.883
The working class in whatever way had to come to terms and be friendly to socialism.

02:10:51.258 --> 02:11:00.650
Other parties did this to just like Hitler they put the word socialist in their party but they wanted to make it clear that they weren't.

02:11:02.133 --> 02:11:14.955
Anything to do with the Soviet Union or alien doing Marxism so they put the word Nacional not see is the first four letters of national nazionale in German and they see is how you spell.

02:11:15.096 --> 02:11:19.799
National in the German national socialism but definite Communists that's right

02:11:19.706 --> 02:11:28.999
the killed comedy they fought communist in the street they had pitched battles they literally threatened each other's existence

02:11:28.996 --> 02:11:38.487
and they lie and the first people and he arrested and put in jail we're not Jews and Gypsies and all the other people he eventually kill it was communists.

02:11:38.682 --> 02:11:47.958
They were the number one and socialist right behind him why because up until he takes power January of 1933 that's when Hitler

02:11:47.874 --> 02:11:57.410
takes power the last elections two of them in 1932 the Socialist and communist the vote together 50% of the vote in Germany so.

02:11:57.596 --> 02:12:06.781
He appealed to them at the German manufacturer the German capitalist and he said the Communists and socialists are going to win.

02:12:07.922 --> 02:12:16.450
You won't and you you're just the capitalist you have too few people you need a mass base and I'm the only one that can do that.

02:12:17.257 --> 02:12:24.002
Let's just the populist message that he used that's right but it was explicitly done as a deal

02:12:23.856 --> 02:12:35.436
the the ruling group said to Hindenburg the old Prussian man who was in charge of the German government at the time you have to invite Hitler to form a new government.

02:12:35.649 --> 02:12:50.532
Otherwise you would never have thought he'd call Hitler nasty names before the Prussian aristocracy looked down on Hitler as in Austin little funny man with a mustache who was Austria wasn't in German you know the mood for them that mattered so

02:12:50.493 --> 02:12:58.913
he comes in as the enemy the Smasher of socialism and communism which he immediately does.

02:13:00.585 --> 02:13:12.768
Only people who don't know or care about the history pick up on the word you know it's like there are people here in the United States who like to say.

02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:21.302
We are not a democracy we are Republic which is like saying I'm not a banana I'm a fruit

02:13:21.245 --> 02:13:29.449
you have to explain to these people bananas so you have to explain the people yes we were Republic

02:13:29.446 --> 02:13:41.998
but we have a commitment to democracy as a way to govern the Republic because the say you're Republic doesn't imply what kind of government you have to go through that with people so they kind of get as certain words

02:13:41.923 --> 02:13:48.228
have power beyond their actual meaning that used in communication whether it's negative,

02:13:48.279 --> 02:13:58.418
like racist or positive like freedom of speech or democrat or double Daddy yeah and then you use that to mean something Wells or negative.

02:13:58.542 --> 02:13:59.895
What is it stop

02:13:59.658 --> 02:14:12.795
Donnie stop being a socialist are some whatever whatever that means that's not even use doesn't any kind of philosophical or economic sense so let's fast forward to today right you mentioned Bernie Sanders right

02:14:12.648 --> 02:14:21.797
there's another popular figure that represents some of ideas of maybe let's call it Democratic socialism and maybe let's try to start

02:14:21.686 --> 02:14:29.710
that sneak up on a definition of what that could possibly mean but AOC Alexandria Ocasio Cortez she's from

02:14:29.662 --> 02:14:38.064
these parts yes greens so maybe if you can comment on Bernie Sanders or ALC

02:14:38.053 --> 02:14:46.977
are they open to some ideas and Marxism are they representing those ideas well in both the economic and the political sense.

02:14:48.369 --> 02:14:49.983
Okay.

02:14:50.791 --> 02:15:01.677
Where do I begin yeah the social the Socialist movement predates marks was always larger than marks and has gone on to develop.

02:15:01.765 --> 02:15:08.321
Separately after marks is death so can we pause on that actually King is there a nice way to

02:15:08.291 --> 02:15:17.125
to delineate draw a line between Marxism and Socialism or or if Marxism is kind of a part of socialism.

02:15:17.284 --> 02:15:25.704
That's been he can you speak to like maybe the try to Define once again what Marxism is and what socialism is right.

02:15:25.864 --> 02:15:31.538
Marxism is a systematic analysis.

02:15:31.886 --> 02:15:41.881
Heavily focused on economics and as I said earlier devoted to mostly a critique.

02:15:42.185 --> 02:15:47.706
Of capitalism
and that's its strength.

02:15:48.126 --> 02:15:59.580
How it does that how it poses the questions how it analyzes the way capitalism works that is really the Forte of the Marxist tradition.

02:15:59.658 --> 02:16:05.242
Socialism is a bigger broader tent within which Marxism.

02:16:05.519 --> 02:16:18.403
Figures it's there so that people who aren't Marxist or nonetheless aware of Marxism like it more or less study it more or less but it's a broader notion

02:16:18.374 --> 02:16:28.261
that I like to use this sentence to describe it's a broad idea that we can do better than some than capitalism and really

02:16:28.231 --> 02:16:37.597
there are all kinds of things about capitalism that are not what we as modern citizens of the world.

02:16:37.927 --> 02:16:41.710
Think are adequate that we are in a tradition.

02:16:42.050 --> 02:16:48.957
That goes back to all the people who thought they could do better than slavery and all the people who thought they could do better than feudalism.

02:16:49.234 --> 02:16:53.918
We've made progress feudalism was a progress over slavery.

02:16:54.158 --> 02:17:04.081
Capitalism was a progress over both of them and progress hasn't stopped and we are the people who in a variety of ways want.

02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:05.890
The progress.

02:17:06.077 --> 02:17:20.663
To go for the further and are not held back by believing that capitalism is somehow the best Beyond which we cannot go or even think we find that to be in the worst sense of the word.

02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:25.533
A reactionary way of thinking and where that large

02:17:25.441 --> 02:17:31.691
Community many of us are not interested in economics all that much we don't think that's

02:17:31.643 --> 02:17:39.379
the focal area we are socialists for example because we want to do something to deal with

02:17:39.322 --> 02:17:52.504
climate change to we think the world is about to kill itself physically and we want to take steps with other people to stop that to me to fix that etcetera etcetera.

02:17:52.835 --> 02:18:00.804
So that's for me a kind of difference is a little difficult to say because there's no other figure.

02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:04.702
Like marks that has an equal.

02:18:05.141 --> 02:18:15.532
Impact an equal place within the broad socialist tradition and the only tradition that comes close might be

02:18:15.457 --> 02:18:21.078
the anarchists tradition but that's very specialized and

02:18:21.066 --> 02:18:34.977
that's a whole nother kind of conversation and whatever you say the influence of the great anarchists thinkers kropotkin bakunin sorell in France and others still doesn't amount.

02:18:35.073 --> 02:18:44.294
To the impact that Marx and Marxism have had so far that could change but I mean up to this point that's the.

02:18:44.490 --> 02:18:45.555
Um

02:18:45.984 --> 02:18:56.141
I think that's a way of understanding the relationship yeah that's an interesting that some of the ideas within anarchism and of course it's a one of the more varied,

02:18:56.202 --> 02:18:59.355
disciplines right there such.

02:18:59.469 --> 02:19:12.220
Maybe by definition such Variety in their thinkers but they kind of stand for a
dismantling of a power center and that.

02:19:12.712 --> 02:19:27.694
If not equates tends to rhyme with some of the ideas of socialism absolutely so where you have the you know there's a whole train of thought in socialist ideas that in Marxist ideas that uses the phrase quote

02:19:27.529 --> 02:19:32.843
the withering away of the state that's a quotation from Lennon.

02:19:33.750 --> 02:19:43.475
People should understand that's a quotation from Lennon and it was made by Lenin positive in other words Lennon was saying.

02:19:43.562 --> 02:19:47.247
That's a good thing that's something we stand for

02:19:47.091 --> 02:20:08.808
we want to create the conditions under which there is a will because you remember the the Communist so what did they weren't called that at first in Russia before the Revolution they were just socialists they were hunted down and persecuted by the government left and right they had no love for the government the government was their literal everyday enemy

02:20:08.607 --> 02:20:16.829
and being critical of government didn't just mean this particular government but of the whole.

02:20:16.916 --> 02:20:28.000
Being a Marxist you always ask the questions of the social constitution of whatever it is you're struggling against so there was this interest why is the state so,

02:20:28.007 --> 02:20:42.215
especially because if you understand feudalism particularly early feudalism it didn't have powerful states one of Lenin's greatest books is called the economic history of Russia and he goes back centuries

02:20:42.077 --> 02:20:50.073
the huge book in three or four inches thick and I'm one of the few people who've read it and.

02:20:50.207 --> 02:20:52.496
He's very good about the absence.

02:20:53.042 --> 02:21:07.719
Of a strong central government in many parts of fuel including inside Russia but also in other parts of Europe the development of a powerful Central State comes towards the end of feudalism as it is desperate to hold on.

02:21:07.896 --> 02:21:12.390
Which ought to be suggestive that maybe the turn to powerful governments

02:21:12.271 --> 02:21:24.310
here in the United States or in Europe and huh is maybe also because this system is exhausted and can't go on and has to Marshall every last,

02:21:24.343 --> 02:21:28.801
bit of power it can not to be.

02:21:28.943 --> 02:21:35.661
Lost in history it would be interesting to see what the Soviet Union would look like if Lana never died hi.

02:21:35.839 --> 02:21:39.929
A lot of people have asked that question over the years a lot of people.

02:21:40.439 --> 02:21:47.670
There is Stalin sliding in in the middle of the night erasing the withering away of the state part yes exactly,

02:21:47.677 --> 02:22:00.282
so just to return briefly back to AOC and Bernie Sanders what are your thoughts about these modern political figures that represent some of these ideas and they sometimes refer to those ideas as Democratic socialism right.

02:22:00.928 --> 02:22:12.363
The crucial thing about Bernie and about AOC and this is particularly true about Bernie because ALCS much younger and Bernie's at older men Bernie.

02:22:12.739 --> 02:22:16.711
Being roughly my age has been around.

02:22:16.844 --> 02:22:26.344
Formatively as a student as an activist then coming up through the ranks and in Burlington Vermont as a mayor and all the rest

02:22:27.224 --> 02:22:38.039
he lived through one for lack of a better term I would call Cold War America and the Taboo in Cold War America running from around 1945 six.

02:22:38.234 --> 02:22:44.088
To the present I mean really never stopped was

02:22:44.013 --> 02:22:58.699
manichean worldview the United States is good it defines democracy and the Soviet Union is awful it defines whatever the opposite of democracy should be called good here evil there.

02:22:58.822 --> 02:23:05.450
It was taken so far that even in among the ranks of.

02:23:05.646 --> 02:23:10.690
Academic individuals it was impossible.

02:23:11.461 --> 02:23:21.078
Have a conversation I mean I can't tell just make it very personal the number of times I would raise my hand in my classes at Harvard.

02:23:21.148 --> 02:23:24.598
Or Stanford or Yale.

02:23:24.685 --> 02:23:35.419
And I would ask the question that had something to do with Marxism because I was studying it on my own that there were no courses to teach this to me except by people who trashed

02:23:35.353 --> 02:23:41.838
you know that other than that and I didn't want that so I would ask a question.

02:23:42.285 --> 02:23:50.992
And I would see in the faces of my teachers both those I didn't much care for and those who were good teachers that I liked fear,

02:23:51.008 --> 02:24:00.264
it's just fear they didn't want to go there they didn't want to answer my question and I after a while I got to know some of them and I found out why

02:24:00.208 --> 02:24:13.976
because you don't know how the rest of the class is going to understand this either they would have to say I don't know which would be the honest truth for many of them but Professor does not want to say in a classroom I don't know that's it's not cool,

02:24:13.991 --> 02:24:16.072
or they'd have to if they knew,

02:24:16.142 --> 02:24:24.642
that have to say something that indicated there's no really much and they want to go to do that or they wouldn't know something.

02:24:25.064 --> 02:24:28.379
And maybe that would be because they were interested.

02:24:28.989 --> 02:24:38.687
They did not want the rest of the students to begin to say hello you know Professor Smith well you know he's interested hmm.

02:24:38.837 --> 02:24:44.818
This is not good for your career you don't know how this is gonna play out who's gonna say what to whom,

02:24:44.851 --> 02:24:56.178
and I could see in their faces what I later learned because they told me don't come to my office hours you took we're in the office we can talk about but I'm that's how bad it was.

02:24:56.356 --> 02:24:59.239
Is it not still pretty much.

02:24:59.524 --> 02:25:07.493
In my field the great so-called debate I find it boring but great debate for my colleagues is

02:25:07.374 --> 02:25:13.273
between what's called neoclassical economics and Keynesian economics neoclassical

02:25:13.073 --> 02:25:30.224
the government should stay out of the economy and work less a fair or liberalism and the Keynesian saying no you you crazy neoclassical if you do that you'll have great depressions and the system will collapse you need the government to come in to solve the problems to fix the,

02:25:30.276 --> 02:25:31.241
weaknesses.

02:25:31.356 --> 02:25:40.523
And they hate each other and they throw each other out of their jobs one of the very few things they can do together that they agree on is keeping people like Meowth.

02:25:40.656 --> 02:25:51.056
That they can find common ground to do so I had to learn it all on my soul why am I telling you this because.

02:25:51.368 --> 02:26:02.390
This taboo means that all of the complicated developments within Marxism and within socialism

02:26:02.351 --> 02:26:09.880
of the post-world war two period the vast bulk of all of that is unknown.

02:26:10.219 --> 02:26:20.026
Not just to the average American person but to the average American academic to the average American who thinks of himself or herself as an intellectual

02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:27.858
I have had to spend a ridiculous amount of my time explaining Soviet history have no idea.

02:26:28.107 --> 02:26:34.276
Or saying there's this man lukacs a Hungarian Marxist he really had interesting.

02:26:34.975 --> 02:26:44.809
Or to explain that gramsci was not a great literary critic he was head of the Communist Party of Italy for most of his adult life

02:26:44.761 --> 02:26:55.098
what does that mean what you like G she is a literary critic but they were and they didn't even know they don't even know it's been erased.

02:26:55.366 --> 02:26:58.293
It's a little bit like stories I've heard about

02:26:58.165 --> 02:27:12.455
Trotsky and his influence kind of erased in the Soviet Union because he obviously fell out of favor and so somehow all of his writings many of which are very interesting and complicated anyway so.

02:27:12.677 --> 02:27:16.155
What you going to have in this country is a slow.

02:27:16.503 --> 02:27:25.976
Awakening of socialism from a long hibernation called the Cold War I never expected to be very honest with you,

02:27:26.036 --> 02:27:35.158
that I would live to see I knew it would come because of these things always do but I didn't expect to see it so I have been surprised.

02:27:35.948 --> 02:27:41.136
As have a lot of us that when it starts to happen it happens fast

02:27:41.106 --> 02:27:55.323
so the you see Bernie is an early sign of the Awakening absolutely for the corridor to accept the idea was always a social we all knew and everybody who paid attention he didn't I did.

02:27:55.870 --> 02:28:06.332
But 2016 he go he makes a decision momentous to run for president he's just a senator from Vermont Vermont is one of the smallest,

02:28:06.357 --> 02:28:18.090
states in the union people who live in Vermont love to tell you that there are more cows than people in Vermont Sentret Sentret so here from this little State this elderly gentleman,

02:28:18.105 --> 02:28:25.840
with a New York City accent runs for office and says I'm a socialist and when they attack and he doesn't run away I must do so.

02:28:25.982 --> 02:28:31.512
I'm a socialist now he had been he wasn't that it wasn't a secret that suddenly got out.

02:28:31.942 --> 02:28:42.764
But the great question and I don't mind telling you because I went to the right schools I know a lot of people in the you know Janet Yellen was my classmate at Yale and stuff like that.

02:28:42.970 --> 02:28:50.967
So I was speaking with a high official of the democratic party and I said well what do you think about Bernie entering the race.

02:28:51.369 --> 02:28:59.284
Makes no difference if they get one percent of the vote all right he was wrong yeah they had no idea what was coming

02:28:59.228 --> 02:29:05.640
but the truth is I didn't either it wasn't just that he didn't get it I thought his 1% was probably right

02:29:05.592 --> 02:29:11.770
so we were both wrong yeah change can happen fast do you think AOC might be president one day yeah.

02:29:12.173 --> 02:29:21.870
Possible possible and but two things number one it's fast number two.

02:29:22.922 --> 02:29:31.918
It's going to go in the following Direction I would guess you begin with the most moderate.

02:29:32.185 --> 02:29:37.453
Calm non-confrontational socialism

02:29:37.325 --> 02:29:52.875
you can imagine so not a OCR Bernie no no they are not confrontational in my judgment in terms of the ideas of socialism yeah I mean they're both very feisty they're feisty personally but not but not ideologically gotta you know she is.

02:29:53.124 --> 02:29:55.117
Bernie is also.

02:29:55.582 --> 02:30:03.290
You know in honest moments and they're both really are pretty honest Folks at least in my experience.

02:30:04.206 --> 02:30:17.522
In honest moments Bernie will tell you that his what he Advocates his Democratic socialism is pretty much what FDR was in the 1930s it was a kind of popular government.

02:30:17.664 --> 02:30:25.697
Tax the rich a lot more than you do now to provide a lot more support for the working class than you do now

02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:37.148
that's not a fundamental change that's what he means by socialism when he talks about it and he's asked for examples he mentions Denmark a lot okay that

02:30:37.028 --> 02:30:46.475
that that's consistent that's the softest kind of socialism and that's where we're going to start in a country coming out of hibernation.

02:30:46.706 --> 02:30:48.959
Pretty soon it's already happening,

02:30:49.028 --> 02:30:59.653
they'll be people who need and want to go further in the direction of socialism then Bernie and AOC are comfortable with you can already see that the shoots of it now.

02:30:59.822 --> 02:31:06.441
You know AOC voted together with most of the others to support the money for Ukraine.

02:31:06.817 --> 02:31:15.588
Okay that a lot of people in the in the Socialist movement do not support that and that's going to happen I don't know exactly how that's going to work out but.

02:31:16.125 --> 02:31:19.990
That should give people an idea there are disagreements and they're going,

02:31:20.014 --> 02:31:26.859
faster and they're gonna drink they don't let people know so people in the social sphere do support money

02:31:26.811 --> 02:31:36.733
from the United States in the large amounts that it is being sent to Ukraine is it because of it's a fundamentally the military-industrial complex is a capitalist institution kind of thing.

02:31:37.037 --> 02:31:46.483
No the what the when there's some people for whom that's the issue then there are people for whom this is you know it's guns and butter and why are we.

02:31:46.778 --> 02:31:52.793
Why are we over there when we have such needs at home that are being neglected and yeah and then there are people who.

02:31:53.692 --> 02:32:01.229
Well go back to what we talked about the beginning who are more like London and Deb's that this is this is a fight between.

02:32:01.650 --> 02:32:11.987
Western capitalism and Russian oligarchs and and want to be oligarchs in Ukraine and what are we doing here we have to insist that these

02:32:11.876 --> 02:32:21.970
forces sit down at the bargaining table and negotiate a settlement don't kill large numbers of Ukraine I mean everybody's willing to fight to the last Ukrainian is

02:32:21.896 --> 02:32:23.960
little strange what are you doing.

02:32:24.299 --> 02:32:39.120
You're supposed to be in favor of Peace you know and for the United States was just finished it invading and occupying Afghanistan and Iraq to be against another country invading mean who in the world is going to take this seriously this is crazy that

02:32:38.982 --> 02:32:48.338
you know I invade it's good and you invade is terrible what you know what are you doing what why are you doing that what what's.

02:32:48.425 --> 02:32:59.644
What's going on here all of these questions are being active by the way not just by socialist by lots of other people do inside the Democratic party and also inside the Republican Party.

02:33:00.056 --> 02:33:06.864
You watch that Tucker Carlson or people like that they are against the stuff in in Ukraine they don't want,

02:33:06.898 --> 02:33:21.790
the money spent there and want the weapon sent their they don't like the whole policy it's and Trump wobble so mr. Biden's policy has got all kinds of Critics on the left and the right and every day that this thing lasts,

02:33:21.860 --> 02:33:29.227
these criticisms get bigger anyway the point is that AOC and Bernie.

02:33:29.512 --> 02:33:38.139
Should be I think evaluated as the early shoots after a long winter of Cold War,

02:33:38.145 --> 02:33:40.570
isolation from the hole,

02:33:40.621 --> 02:33:49.121
you know what I explain to people the the contribution made for example to Modern Marxism I'll give you an example by the

02:33:48.939 --> 02:33:56.846
the French philosopher Lewis l to say I don't know if the name means anything to you okay he was the Rector

02:33:56.654 --> 02:34:02.183
of the ecole normale Superior in Paris that's equivalent,

02:34:02.190 --> 02:34:09.440
imagine in this country if there were a university that combined Harvard Yale Princeton and MIT,

02:34:09.491 --> 02:34:23.104
it would be the universe well they call normal in France in Paris is the he was a tenured professor who became the Rector the Rector is like the president of the University

02:34:23.093 --> 02:34:36.528
an active member of the French Communist Party most of his adult life that was possible in France during the Cold War that was Unthinkable in this country who could not in a million years right so

02:34:36.516 --> 02:34:39.173
Altus Air is a philosopher.

02:34:39.549 --> 02:34:48.284
Tried to bring a version of post-modernism into Marxism with enormous

02:34:48.246 --> 02:34:59.212
impact all over the world why he'd travel not just in Europe all over right so if you want to look him up I'll spell it out for you sure alth

02:34:59.174 --> 02:35:00.978
u.s.s.

02:35:00.903 --> 02:35:15.336
ER Louis the Louis's perello you is Louis althusser look at map you'll see tons of stuff by the way MIT press is a major publisher if I remember of his Works in English.

02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:22.771
By the way the textbook I wrote in the economics in case you're ever interested was also published by the MIT press and the title.

02:35:22.985 --> 02:35:34.268
Of the contending economic theories neoclassical Keynesian and Mark see of that's a no my marxian yeah that's right and by the way when we think,

02:35:34.274 --> 02:35:39.597
I don't know if there's an interesting distinction between marxian economics and Marxist.

02:35:40.306 --> 02:35:47.590
Is the supposed Marxism is the umbrella yeah of everything that I only use it because Marxist.

02:35:47.868 --> 02:35:56.738
Use as a noun a person is a Marxist marxian used as an adjective to qualify but other I don't mean some great,

02:35:56.798 --> 02:36:06.775
different there's a last point I would like to make about AOC and Bernie that's also General
I'm a historian to.

02:36:07.096 --> 02:36:15.272
And I know that the transition out of feudalism in Europe that capitalism was a transition that took centuries

02:36:15.217 --> 02:36:25.922
and that occurred in fits and starts so for example a funeral manner would start to disintegrate serfs would run away then run into a town

02:36:25.839 --> 02:36:31.882
how would they live in the town they had no land anymore because they had run away from the feudal Manor.

02:36:32.564 --> 02:36:41.866
A deal was struck without the people involved in the deal understanding what they were doing a merchant would say to one of these Serfs.

02:36:42.394 --> 02:36:50.624
I'm in the business of buying and then reselling stuff and living off the difference but you know I could make more money if I produce some of this stuff

02:36:50.532 --> 02:36:57.502
myself rather than buy it from somebody else so I'm going to I'm going to make you a deal I'm going to give you money

02:36:57.419 --> 02:37:08.944
once a week I give you a money what we would later call a wage and you come here and under my supervision you make this crap that I'm going to then sell and this all works a in other words

02:37:08.924 --> 02:37:18.118
there were there were efforts unconscious not self-aware to go out of feudalism to a new system.

02:37:18.917 --> 02:37:22.295
Some of them lasted a few days and then fell apart.

02:37:22.535 --> 02:37:29.631
Some of them lasted weeks or months or years but it took a long time before.

02:37:29.935 --> 02:37:38.040
The conditions were ready for a kind of a General Switch and once that was done

02:37:37.965 --> 02:37:46.430
it grew on itself and became the global capitalist system we have today that's the only model we have so for me

02:37:46.283 --> 02:37:53.830
that's what I see when I look at socialism I see the Paris commune was an event an attempt.

02:37:54.458 --> 02:38:00.284
Less than a few weeks I see Russia that was an attempt lasted 70 years

02:38:00.255 --> 02:38:11.556
then I see a human fill in the blank I see these are all early experiments these are all you learns things to do learn things never to do again

02:38:11.526 --> 02:38:20.099
The Good The Bad what do you build on how do you learn and that's what the Socialist and Marxist tradition when it's serious.

02:38:20.375 --> 02:38:28.840
That's what it does so in the idea is sort of capitalism was a significant improvement over the feudalism yes and

02:38:28.792 --> 02:38:37.121
we are coming to an age in over slavery and we're coming to an age where capitalism will die out and make it's not that

02:38:36.975 --> 02:38:40.173
Capra's so how fundamentally broken

02:38:40.018 --> 02:38:52.533
it's better than the things that came before but there is going to be things yet better and the day will be grounded in the ideas of Marxism and socialism is there just just a linger briefly at a

02:38:52.459 --> 02:38:58.853
the way Marxism is used as a term on Twitter,

02:38:58.905 --> 02:39:03.804
there's something called I'm sorry if I'm using the terms incorrectly but,

02:39:03.838 --> 02:39:16.075
cultural Marxism right criticisms of the University's being infiltrated by cultural marxists I'm not exactly sure I don't.

02:39:16.189 --> 02:39:25.329
Pay close enough no one is no no but it's woke it's there's a there's a kind of woke ideology that I'm not exactly sure.

02:39:25.569 --> 02:39:37.536
What is not you that what is the fundamental that text that was the Karl Marx of woke - all I do know is that there are certain characteristics.

02:39:37.696 --> 02:39:41.695
Of woke ideology which is.

02:39:41.810 --> 02:39:51.930
Hard lines are drawn between the good guys and the bad guys and basically everyone is a bad guy except

02:39:51.784 --> 02:40:00.780
except the people that are very loudly non-stop saying that they're the good guy and that applies across for internet for the racism

02:40:00.732 --> 02:40:09.936
for sexism for gender or gender politics identity politics all that kind of stuff is there.

02:40:10.644 --> 02:40:20.567
Is there any parallels between marxian economics and Marxist ideology and whatever is being called Marxism on Twitter.

02:40:20.816 --> 02:40:22.160
No not much.

02:40:22.410 --> 02:40:35.169
Mostly marks that you have to do one of the consequences of the taboo after World War 2 is that Marxism like socialism and communism become swear words it's like calling somebody.

02:40:35.589 --> 02:40:47.547
Well I want to use bad language but using a four-letter word to describe somebody so instead of calling them this or that you call him a Marxist in many circles this.

02:40:47.877 --> 02:40:59.204
Is even worse than whatever other adjective you might use but it doesn't have a particular meaning that I can assess the closest you get is your little list.

02:40:59.598 --> 02:41:03.462
It is somebody who is concerned about.

02:41:03.910 --> 02:41:13.743
Race and sex and sexual orientation gender and and all of those things and wants there to be trans.

02:41:13.912 --> 02:41:26.103
Gendered bathrooms and I did that and I don't like any of these people so I slapped the word Marxism or the phrase cultural Marxism because it isn't Marxism about,

02:41:26.173 --> 02:41:33.683
getting more money or controlling the industry or all those things that dimly we know Marxist somehow

02:41:33.681 --> 02:41:41.281
are concerned about so this is odds and say don't know much about Muslim I've always been interested in culture I mean

02:41:41.180 --> 02:41:55.603
lukacs the man I mentioned to you before gramsci that's what they're famous for the analysis of what Marxism particularly has to say about culture gramsci rights at Great length about the Catholic church about,

02:41:55.637 --> 02:42:05.219
theater and painting and in Italy and on and I mean this is just ignorance talking they don't know anything about that it wouldn't know what their names are

02:42:05.144 --> 02:42:12.826
it's a it's a label that summarizes kind of a shorthand I'm against all of these I don't want to be told

02:42:12.742 --> 02:42:19.280
that is ugly racism in this country it always has been or sexism or,

02:42:19.304 --> 02:42:28.300
phobia against gay people whatever it is that's agitating them random Marxism or socialism I mean it's just.

02:42:28.478 --> 02:42:36.556
It's like socialism is the post office it is it is a mentality well but I don't blame them I mean it's childish.

02:42:36.940 --> 02:42:38.481
It's mean-spirited.

02:42:38.785 --> 02:42:51.139
But it comes out of the fact no one ever sat them down and said deal here is this tradition it's got these kinds of things that people kind of share and these big differences look.

02:42:51.244 --> 02:43:01.212
An intelligent society which this country is could have and should have done that it was fear and a kind of Terror.

02:43:01.489 --> 02:43:13.276
That made them behave in the way they did and we're now seeing it having said that there is such a thing as cultural Marxism what that is is simply those marxists.

02:43:14.317 --> 02:43:23.529
Who devoted themselves to analyzing how it is that a particular culture

02:43:23.310 --> 02:43:37.563
is on the one hand shaped by capitalism and on the other hand becomes a condition for capitalism to survive and grow in other words how do we analyze the interaction between.

02:43:37.858 --> 02:43:43.640
The class struggle on the job and attitude towards sexuality or.

02:43:43.944 --> 02:43:48.861
Movements in music or whatever else culture and there are.

02:43:49.066 --> 02:43:59.961
Georg lukács this Hungarian great name and are the greatest of all the names Antonio gramsci and a modern name just died a couple years ago a British

02:43:59.797 --> 02:44:09.260
intellectual named Stuart Hall h all you want to if you want if I were teaching which I have done a course in cultural Marxism.

02:44:09.429 --> 02:44:17.533
Those would be three major blocks on the syllabus I would give you articles and books to read,

02:44:17.558 --> 02:44:30.973
of their stuff because it has been so seminal in provoking many many others so there is something to be said and understood about the kind of culture that capitalism creates and the kind of culture that enables

02:44:30.899 --> 02:44:32.226
capitalism yes,

02:44:32.295 --> 02:44:45.189
and Mark just are particularly those who like to look at that interaction in other words they're interested in how capitalism shapes culture and how culture shapes capitalism there's another name I forgot

02:44:44.997 --> 02:44:52.453
Stuart Hall is British G she is Italian lukich is Hungarian.

02:44:52.568 --> 02:45:03.003
The German is Walter Benjamin B enj am i n he was a member of the Frankfurt School which is a huge School

02:45:02.875 --> 02:45:08.100
of Marxism that developed in Frankfurt Germany and that has a lot of people,

02:45:08.142 --> 02:45:13.770
many of whom were interested in cultural questions it was a bit of a reaction against,

02:45:13.813 --> 02:45:20.460
the narrow Marxism that was so focused on economics and politics there were people who said you're leaving out.

02:45:20.754 --> 02:45:32.783
Very important parts of modern society that are shaping the economy as much as they are shaped by it and it was that impetus to open Marxism to be more inclusive

02:45:32.781 --> 02:45:38.320
in what it deemed to be important to understand that this cult and they call themselves.

02:45:38.407 --> 02:45:51.040
Cultural Marxist but they had a completely different meaning from this this is just you know just bad-mouthing that's all let me ask a more personal question social,

02:45:51.047 --> 02:46:02.860
for most of the 20th century not most but a large many decades in the United States as a consequence of the Cold War and before being a Marxist is one of the worst things you could be.

02:46:03.371 --> 02:46:13.203
Have you had dark periods in your own life where you've gone to some dark places in your mind where it was difficult.

02:46:13.453 --> 02:46:14.879
Like self-doubt.

02:46:15.632 --> 02:46:25.888
Difficult to know like what the hell am I doing when you're surrounded by colleagues and people you said prestigious universities both personal interest of career.

02:46:26.191 --> 02:46:28.552
But also as a human being when everybody.

02:46:29.684 --> 02:46:37.987
Yo kind of looks at you funny because you're studying this thing did that ever get you real low no.

02:46:38.444 --> 02:46:51.193
I know people that who had the exactly what you said I mean your questions perfectly reasonable if I were you I'd be asking me that question do and what's wrong with you nothing wrong with the question yeah.

02:46:51.596 --> 02:47:00.051
And here's the honest truth I don't know how anomalous I am I really don't but the truth is no I have.

02:47:00.148 --> 02:47:14.662
If my wife was sitting here she tell you what she tells me which is I have been tremendously Lucky in my life which is true but then again luck never is the only explanation for things that's part of it.

02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:15.977
Um

02:47:18.819 --> 02:47:33.675
What can I say I didn't choose the time of my birth I didn't choose the communities in which I grew up other schools I attended or anything else no but the fact that there is no courses or extensive courses on marxian economics but you know again it's I'm Hegel.

02:47:33.970 --> 02:47:42.966
On the one hand I was denied good instruction on the other hand I had to go out and learn it on my own and the motivation.

02:47:43.377 --> 02:47:56.801
When you do that it's very different I'm not the student who sits there with my notebook taking notes of what the great professor says and reading the text and getting ready for the exam I don't have an exam

02:47:56.754 --> 02:48:07.181
I had and I'm doing something slightly risk are you know kind of yeah romantically different and oppositional

02:48:07.062 --> 02:48:10.791
I was able to find always

02:48:10.753 --> 02:48:20.379
one or two professors that I could talk to outside of the classroom situation other students who felt enough similar to me

02:48:20.250 --> 02:48:26.150
that we could get together and read these books and talk about them I had a number of really

02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:34.512
fortuitous people who were kind to me and gave me of their time and their effort to teach me along the way.

02:48:34.717 --> 02:48:39.680
Um and I've had the benefit that because I went to all these fancy schools.

02:48:40.109 --> 02:48:50.150
I do know a lot of people who are in high places in this culture and when I have been put in difficult positions I often wave my pedigree.

02:48:50.246 --> 02:48:54.939
And it works like garlic with the devil about the way they back away.

02:48:55.242 --> 02:49:08.235
Because Americans are very deferential to us that kind of academic Prestige but there's a personal psychological thing that seems that you have never been shaken by this sea of the.

02:49:08.556 --> 02:49:14.230
Just naturally somebody who just has perseverance.

02:49:14.921 --> 02:49:23.710
Well I would put it I mean I understand what you're saying but I would put a little differently I think capitalism struck me early on in my life.

02:49:24.769 --> 02:49:26.590
It's not that great assistant.

02:49:27.119 --> 02:49:36.619
And nothing has happened to change my mind in other words the development
just.

02:49:38.687 --> 02:49:50.087
Just kept giving me more and more evidence that this and I must say over the last 10 years what's really changed the last 10 years I mean,

02:49:50.102 --> 02:49:56.766
I Can't Describe to you how big that change is and and that may be more important than anything else we've discussed.

02:49:57.223 --> 02:50:01.520
Up until 10 years ago I would do a public event.

02:50:02.048 --> 02:50:10.404
An interview on television or radio thing or give a talk at some conference or something.

02:50:10.510 --> 02:50:15.689
Once every two or three months I'd be invited and I would do like academics often do.

02:50:16.911 --> 02:50:21.298
I now do two to three to four interviews every day.

02:50:21.898 --> 02:50:30.498
So there's a hunger they will how is there only it's that you know and I want to be honest with you.

02:50:30.576 --> 02:50:43.100
As I say at the end of some of my talks allowed it to be kind of a pregnant pause from the podium you know that I leaned into the microphone and I say with as much Smile as I can get.

02:50:43.350 --> 02:50:52.453
I'm having the time of my life and that's the truth yeah that's the truth I never expected look

02:50:52.451 --> 02:51:05.453
I'm used to teaching a classroom a seminar for graduate students with eight or nine or 10 students or a or a regular undergraduate class with 30 or an occasional introductory course with a few hundred

02:51:05.343 --> 02:51:08.504
I've done all of those things many times.

02:51:08.836 --> 02:51:22.576
But an audience you know that I can count in the hundreds of thousands on YouTube and all of that know that that's new is there advice you can give given your.

02:51:23.014 --> 02:51:24.367
Bold,

02:51:24.419 --> 02:51:37.988
and non-standard career and life advice you can give to high school students college students about how to have a career like that or maybe how do I have a career or life that can be proud of.

02:51:39.173 --> 02:51:47.800
Yeah
first of all my advice is go for it the conditions for doing that now.

02:51:47.986 --> 02:51:54.300
Infinitely better than they were when I had to do it and I could do it.

02:51:54.666 --> 02:52:03.896
And I can I'm happy I did it becoming a teacher is it one of those decisions I made that I've never regretted.

02:52:05.631 --> 02:52:14.627
And I've never regretted being a Critic of this society never I find it edifying I find it.

02:52:15.317 --> 02:52:21.630
I mean the Gratitude people expressed to me for helping them see kind of what's going on.

02:52:21.781 --> 02:52:29.921
Is unbelievably encouraging or what what can I tell you so that kills you that feels you enjoy pointing out that the emperor has no clothes feels you,

02:52:29.991 --> 02:52:35.206
it's that's that's a life and not just important as the joy because you're most of the people.

02:52:35.608 --> 02:52:43.740
Who say something like that to me are people who if they had the vocabulary and some of them do would say you know.

02:52:44.377 --> 02:52:49.736
I thought I was seeing through that outfit that ever was wearing yeah I thought it

02:52:49.616 --> 02:53:01.042
and they did and all they needed was a little extra this information or that factoid or this logic I and they have that and I remember having that too,

02:53:01.085 --> 02:53:07.812
when I had a teacher who made something clear that had been murky I always felt gratitude.

02:53:07.945 --> 02:53:13.213
And now I get that gratitude a good bit and a yes it is enormously.

02:53:13.805 --> 02:53:19.271
Gratifying and I'm not sure I could could get it any other way and it.

02:53:20.512 --> 02:53:26.609
I had learned and I'm walking proof that being a Critic of society.

02:53:26.939 --> 02:53:31.623
And doing it systematically and sharing it with other people.

02:53:31.954 --> 02:53:37.340
Makes for a very good life very good life.

02:53:37.490 --> 02:53:43.939
Speaking of which however one other aspect of human nature is that life comes to an end.

02:53:44.017 --> 02:53:51.969
Mmm do you think about your death are you afraid of it afraid of it no think about it yes yes.

02:53:52.416 --> 02:53:54.075
I'm not afraid.

02:53:54.441 --> 02:54:03.392
I've always thought you know death is hard for the people that are left when you're dead you know very much so it's.

02:54:04.083 --> 02:54:14.987
I worry more about my wife I'm very attached to my wife I am I mentioned to you I got married when I was 23 years old and that's my wife did his day.

02:54:15.831 --> 02:54:29.741
So I'm lucky because that's if you get married to anybody and at age 23 the either locked or it isn't what is what role has this love played in your life enormous.

02:54:30.369 --> 02:54:39.941
Because I came from a family you know if your family is political refugees which mine were who had to interrupt their lives

02:54:39.813 --> 02:54:50.104
moved to another continent learn another language find another life income and job and as the disruption

02:54:50.102 --> 02:54:57.298
those real deep for any Refugee so so my mother and father were both refugees.

02:54:57.826 --> 02:55:05.319
They met as refugees
so I had to in a way.

02:55:06.595 --> 02:55:15.491
Make it up to them I had to be I was the first child of there I was younger sister but who the first child and.

02:55:16.452 --> 02:55:25.475
You know there's a lot of psychological pressure on you if you're in that situation nobody means you arm but you've got to do.

02:55:25.625 --> 02:55:33.298
What they couldn't what was shut off to them in a way they want you to do it's the closest they're going to get.

02:55:33.421 --> 02:55:45.144
To what they had hoped and my parents were both University students my father was a lawyer my mother had to leave the university to run for her life.

02:55:46.727 --> 02:55:51.743
So I had to perform one thing I School here in the United States I.

02:55:51.858 --> 02:56:01.466
I had to get all A's I had to be on the football team I had to play the violin the orchestra had do all these because everything had to be achieved.

02:56:01.958 --> 02:56:03.375
So I'm going to achievement,

02:56:03.444 --> 02:56:12.089
crazy person that way and but that's functional in this dysfunctional Society but on top of that Destiny achievement.

02:56:12.374 --> 02:56:23.350
Within the game of this particular society then loves seems to be a thing that's greater than that game is that something that made you a better person all God how is it,

02:56:23.420 --> 02:56:30.651
how's the weather better marxian and a better everything because my wife my wife by profession.

02:56:30.928 --> 02:56:36.142
Is a psychotherapist excellent I love it and I needed it yeah.

02:56:36.248 --> 02:56:43.902
And So I Married it I didn't know what I was doing at the time but I think as I look back on it that was more,

02:56:43.972 --> 02:56:46.388
more than a little what was going on.

02:56:46.781 --> 02:56:54.796
And she has tutored me all my life about a whole range of aspects of life that my family never.

02:56:54.973 --> 02:56:58.900
Talked about never dealt with never.

02:56:59.024 --> 02:57:09.900
At least explicitly engaged in any of that because it was all about survival The Immigrant challenges survives survives about and you're so busy.

02:57:11.033 --> 02:57:13.564
That you tell yourself you can't do that,

02:57:13.580 --> 02:57:28.121
of course you can and there are other reasons why you're not going to look at those problems but the survival is so urgent that you can fool yourself this way and my parents did that one last question.

02:57:28.317 --> 02:57:30.355
What's the meaning of life ritual.

02:57:30.694 --> 02:57:40.455
Why will he won't you mr. marks let's go life is struggle and not for me.

02:57:41.100 --> 02:57:46.630
I have found
that to be true that the struggle.

02:57:47.258 --> 02:57:56.146
Whether it is to build a relationship with your child I have two children whether it's to build one with your spouse

02:57:55.999 --> 02:58:02.628
whether it's to understand the complicated argument and simplify it so that you can.

02:58:02.742 --> 02:58:14.439
Share the pleasure of understanding this the relationship to a student or to an audience these are the it's a struggle to do all those things but that.

02:58:14.607 --> 02:58:24.124
That network of struggles that makes life
interesting intriguing and satisfied.

02:58:24.527 --> 02:58:37.844

02:58:50.463 --> 02:58:58.208
The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways the point however is to change it.
