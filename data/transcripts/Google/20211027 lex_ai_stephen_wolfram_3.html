<br>

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[8:02]</small> <span title="8:02 - 8:08" data-start="00:08:01.624" data-end="00:08:08.153">Let Us return again to the core idea of complexity what is complexity.</span><br>
<span title="8:08 - 8:18" data-start="00:08:08.403" data-end="00:08:17.768">I don't know I think that's not the most interesting question it's like you know if you ask a biologist what is life yeah that's not the question they care the most about.</span><br>
<br>

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[8:18]</small> <span title="8:18 - 8:21" data-start="00:08:18.449" data-end="00:08:21.405">What I was interested in is how does.</span><br>
<br>

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[8:22]</small> <span title="8:22 - 8:33" data-start="00:08:21.852" data-end="00:08:33.207">Something that we would usually identifies complexity arise in nature and I got interested in that question like 50 years ago which is really embarrassingly long time ago and you know I was.</span><br>
<span title="8:33 - 8:47" data-start="00:08:33.384" data-end="00:08:47.232">You know how does snowflakes got to have complicated forms how the galaxies get to have complicated shapes how does you know how to living systems get produced things like that and the question is what's the sort of underlying scientific basis for those kinds of things.</span><br>
<span title="8:47 - 8:48" data-start="00:08:47.454" data-end="00:08:48.087">And.</span><br>
<span title="8:48 - 9:00" data-start="00:08:48.157" data-end="00:09:00.403">The thing that I was at first very surprised because I've been in doing physics and particle physics some fancy mathematical physics and so on it's like I know all this fancy stuff I should be able to solve this sort of basic science question.</span><br>
<span title="9:00 - 9:03" data-start="00:09:00.490" data-end="00:09:02.644">And I couldn't this was Blake</span><br>
<span title="9:03 - 9:17" data-start="00:09:02.623" data-end="00:09:17.219">early maybe 1980s time frame and it's like okay what can one do to understand the sort of basic secret that nature seems to have because seems like nature you look around in the natural world that's full of incredibly complicated forms.</span><br>
<span title="9:17 - 9:18" data-start="00:09:17.342" data-end="00:09:18.263">You look at.</span><br>
<br>

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[9:18]</small> <span title="9:18 - 9:32" data-start="00:09:18.467" data-end="00:09:31.640">Sort of most engineered kinds of things for instance they tend to be you know we got some sort of circles and lines and things like this the question is what secret does nature have that lets it make all this complexity,</span><br>
<span title="9:32 - 9:39" data-start="00:09:31.683" data-end="00:09:38.671">that we in doing engineering for example don't naturally seem to have and so that was the kind of the thing that I got interested in.</span><br>
<span title="9:39 - 9:45" data-start="00:09:38.794" data-end="00:09:44.955">And then the question was you know could I understand that with things like mathematical physics well didn't work very well.</span><br>
<span title="9:45 - 9:56" data-start="00:09:45.024" data-end="00:09:56.334">So then I got to thinking about okay is there some other way to try to understand this and then the question was if you're going to look at some system in nature how do you make a model for that system for what that system does.</span><br>
<span title="9:56 - 10:06" data-start="00:09:56.394" data-end="00:10:05.696">So you know model is some abstract representation of the system some formal representation system what are the what is the raw material that you can make that model out of</span><br>

<span title="25:59 - 26:13" data-start="00:25:59.330" data-end="00:26:12.675">and the real strength of it is we've got this model for physics but it turns out it's a foundational kind of model that's a different kind of computation like model that I'm kind of calling the sort of multi computational model and</span><br>
<span title="26:13 - 26:19" data-start="00:26:12.627" data-end="00:26:18.994">that's that kind of model is applicable not only to physics but also to lots of other kinds of things,</span><br>
<span title="26:19 - 26:25" data-start="00:26:19.018" data-end="00:26:24.891">and one reason that's extremely powerful is because physics has been very successful so we know a lot.</span><br>

<span title="26:51 - 27:00" data-start="00:26:51.120" data-end="00:27:00.126">sort of you go and you explain why is that complexity in the natural world then you realize well there's all this complexity there's all this computational irreducibility</span><br>
<span title="27:00 - 27:14" data-start="00:26:59.979" data-end="00:27:14.457">you know there's a lot we can't know about what's going to happen it's kind of kind of very confusing thing for people who say you know science is nailed everything down we're going to you know based on science we can know everything well actually there's this computational irreducibility thing right in the middle of that.</span><br>
<span title="27:15 - 27:20" data-start="00:27:14.661" data-end="00:27:19.984">Throwing up by science so to speak and then the question is well given computational irreducibility.</span><br>
<span title="27:20 - 27:28" data-start="00:27:20.090" data-end="00:27:27.582">How can we actually figure out anything about what happens in the world why aren't we why are we able to predict anything why are we able to operate in the world.</span><br>
<span title="27:28 - 27:36" data-start="00:27:27.760" data-end="00:27:35.955">And the answer is that we sort of live in these slices of computational reusability that exist in this kind of ocean of computational irreducibility.</span><br>
<span title="27:36 - 27:44" data-start="00:27:36.087" data-end="00:27:43.552">And it turns out that seems that it's a very fundamental feature of the kind of model that seems to operate in physics.</span><br>

<span title="51:13 - 51:18" data-start="00:51:12.909" data-end="00:51:17.881">but they can also merge they can be two states of the universe which the next state.</span><br>

<span title="51:26 - 51:41" data-start="00:51:25.566" data-end="00:51:40.540">is critical and somewhat non-trivial for these hyper graphs because there's a whole graph isomorphism Story and there's a whole very elaborate setups for that cause 0 and variance comes in yes I'm honored among other things right yes that's but so so then what happens is.</span><br>
<span title="51:41 - 51:50" data-start="00:51:40.645" data-end="00:51:50.487">That what what one seeing Okay so we've got this thing that's branching and merging etc etc etc okay so now the question is how do we perceive that.</span><br>

<span title="52:06 - 52:11" data-start="00:52:06.148" data-end="00:52:11.120">and so what quantum mechanics becomes a story of is how does a branching brain</span><br>

<span title="2:45:32 - 2:45:45" data-start="02:45:31.656" data-end="02:45:45.009">and it's like I've always said I know nothing about chemistry I learned all the chemistry I know you know the night before some exam when I was 14 years old yeah but I've actually learned a bunch more chemistry and in and Wolfram language these days we have really pretty nice symbolic representation of chemistry</span><br>
<span title="2:45:45 - 2:45:50" data-start="02:45:44.997" data-end="02:45:49.519">and in understanding the design of that I've actually I think learn to set them out of chemistry,</span><br>
<span title="2:45:50 - 2:45:57" data-start="02:45:49.525" data-end="02:45:57.404">stuff you quiz me on sort of basic high school chemistry I would probably totally fail but but but okay so what is chemistry,</span><br>
<span title="2:45:57 - 2:46:02" data-start="02:45:57.411" data-end="02:46:01.581">I mean chemistry is sort of a story of chemical reactions,</span><br>
<span title="2:46:02 - 2:46:14" data-start="02:46:01.624" data-end="02:46:14.437">like you've got this particular chemical it's represented as some graph of you know these are these are this configuration of molecules with these bonds and so on and the chemical reaction happens you've got these sort of two graphs,</span><br>
<span title="2:46:14 - 2:46:21" data-start="02:46:14.452" data-end="02:46:20.577">they interact in some way you've got another graph for multiple other graphs out so that's kind of the the sort of the,</span><br>
<span title="2:46:21 - 2:46:31" data-start="02:46:20.610" data-end="02:46:30.911">the abstract view of what's happening in chemistry and so when you do a chemical synthesis for example you are given certain sort of these are possible reactions that can happen.</span><br>

<span title="2:47:00 - 2:47:08" data-start="02:47:00.364" data-end="02:47:08.063">but anyway so that's kind of the view is that that chemistry chemical reactions of this story of all these different sort of Paths of possible,</span><br>
<span title="2:47:08 - 2:47:11" data-start="02:47:08.079" data-end="02:47:11.170">things that go on okay let's go to an even lower level.</span><br>
<span title="2:47:11 - 2:47:19" data-start="02:47:11.293" data-end="02:47:18.939">Let's say instead of asking about which species of molecules were talking about let's look at individual molecules.</span><br>

<span title="2:47:35 - 2:47:45" data-start="02:47:35.185" data-end="02:47:45.018">In fact in the underlying theory of multi computation there these things we call token event graphs which are basically you've broken your state into tokens,</span><br>
<span title="2:47:45 - 2:47:57" data-start="02:47:45.024" data-end="02:47:56.630">like in the case of hypergraph you broken it into hyper edges and each event is just consuming some number of tokens and producing some number of tokens but then you have to there's a lot of work to be done in update rules.</span><br>

<span title="2:48:20 - 2:48:34" data-start="02:48:19.953" data-end="02:48:33.666">these update rules well if we can enable our mystery battery probably discover them automatically but I think in reality right now it's like there are these particular reactions and I really to understand what's going on we're probably going to pick a particular subtype</span><br>
<span title="2:48:34 - 2:48:41" data-start="02:48:33.529" data-end="02:48:41.002">of chemistry and just because we let me explain where this is going this is the place that his where this is going so.</span><br>

<span title="2:49:22 - 2:49:29" data-start="02:49:22.375" data-end="02:49:29.120">It just asking you know the for the One path another thing you might care about is I want to know the concentration of each species.</span><br>
<span title="2:49:29 - 2:49:43" data-start="02:49:29.181" data-end="02:49:43.146">But I want to know you know at every stage I'm going to solve the differential equations that represent the concentrations and I want to know what those all are but there's more because when and it's kind of like you're going below and statistical mechanics.</span><br>
<span title="2:49:43 - 2:49:51" data-start="02:49:43.251" data-end="02:49:50.816">That's kind of all these molecules bouncing around and you might say we just going to ignore we're just going to look at the aggregate.</span><br>
<span title="2:49:51 - 2:49:58" data-start="02:49:50.975" data-end="02:49:57.711">Densities of certain kinds of molecules but you can look at a lower level you can look at this whole graph a possible interactions.</span><br>
<span title="2:49:58 - 2:50:03" data-start="02:49:57.826" data-end="02:50:03.356">And so the kind of the idea would be what you know is the only chemical Observer.</span><br>
<span title="2:50:04 - 2:50:10" data-start="02:50:03.506" data-end="02:50:10.468">One who just cares about overall concentrations or can there be a chemical Observer who cares about this network of what happened.</span><br>
<span title="2:50:11 - 2:50:20" data-start="02:50:10.726" data-end="02:50:20.397">And so that the question then is so let me give an analogy so this is where I think this is potentially very relevant to molecular molecular biology and molecular computing.</span><br>
<br>

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[2:50:21]</small> <span title="2:50:21 - 2:50:30" data-start="02:50:20.746" data-end="02:50:30.255">When we think about a computation usually we say its input its output we you know what chemistry we say there's this input we're going to make this molecule as the out.</span><br>

<span title="2:50:39 - 2:50:47" data-start="02:50:39.173" data-end="02:50:47.215">What if it isn't just the input and output that we care about what if there's some dynamics of the network that we care about now imagine you're a chemical Observer.</span><br>
<span title="2:50:47 - 2:50:51" data-start="02:50:47.410" data-end="02:50:50.644">What is the chemical Observer well in molecular biology.</span><br>
<span title="2:50:51 - 2:51:02" data-start="02:50:50.714" data-end="02:51:01.619">There are all kinds of weird sorts of observers there are membranes that exist that have you know different kinds of molecules that can bind to them things like this it's not obvious that the</span><br>
<span title="2:51:02 - 2:51:08" data-start="02:51:01.553" data-end="02:51:08.153">from a human scale we just measure the concentration of something is the relevant story we can imagine that,</span><br>
<span title="2:51:08 - 2:51:18" data-start="02:51:08.169" data-end="02:51:17.633">for example when we look at this whole network of possible reactions we can imagine you know to physical level we can imagine what was the actual momentum direction of that of that molecule,</span><br>
<span title="2:51:18 - 2:51:25" data-start="02:51:17.685" data-end="02:51:25.259">what was which we don't pay any attention to when we just talking about chemical concentrations what was the orientation of that molecule these kinds of things.</span><br>
<span title="2:51:25 - 2:51:33" data-start="02:51:25.382" data-end="02:51:33.226">And so here's the his the place where I'm have a little suspicion okay so one of the questions in biology is what matters in biology.</span><br>
<br>

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[2:51:34]</small> <span title="2:51:34 - 2:51:42" data-start="02:51:33.511" data-end="02:51:42.210">And that is you know we have all these chemical reactions we have all these all these molecular processes going on in you know in biological systems what matters.</span><br>
<br>

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[2:51:43]</small> <span title="2:51:43 - 2:51:45" data-start="02:51:42.504" data-end="02:51:44.686">And you know one of the things is.</span><br>
<span title="2:51:45 - 2:51:55" data-start="02:51:44.782" data-end="02:51:54.542">To be able to tell what matters well so a big story of the what matters question was what happened in genetics in 1953 when DNA was figured out how DNA worked.</span><br>
<span title="2:51:55 - 2:52:06" data-start="02:51:54.684" data-end="02:52:05.967">Because before that time you know genetics have been all these different effects and complicated things and then it was realized ah there's something new a molecule can store information which wasn't obvious before that time,</span><br>
<span title="2:52:06 - 2:52:19" data-start="02:52:06.009" data-end="02:52:18.560">a single molecule can store information so there's a place where there can be something important that's happening in microbiology and it's just in the sequence that storing information in a molecule so the possibility now is</span><br>
<span title="2:52:19 - 2:52:20" data-start="02:52:18.504" data-end="02:52:20.497">imagine this Dynamic Network.</span><br>
<span title="2:52:21 - 2:52:30" data-start="02:52:20.629" data-end="02:52:30.246">This you know causal graphs and multi-way causal graphs and so on that represent all of these different reactions between molecules what if there is some aspect of that,</span><br>
<span title="2:52:30 - 2:52:41" data-start="02:52:30.279" data-end="02:52:41.012">that is storing information that's relevant for my field of biology in the dynamic aspect of that yes that's right so that it's similar to how the structure of a DNA molecule.</span><br>
<span title="2:52:41 - 2:52:51" data-start="02:52:41.127" data-end="02:52:50.644">Stores information they could be the Dynamics of the system stores information and this kind of process might allow you to give predictions of what that</span><br>
<span title="2:52:51 - 2:52:58" data-start="02:52:50.642" data-end="02:52:58.350">would be well yes but we also imagine that you're trying to do for example imagine you're trying to do molecular computation.</span><br>
<span title="2:52:59 - 2:53:06" data-start="02:52:58.600" data-end="02:53:06.002">Okay you might think the way we're going to do molecular computation is we're just going to run the thing we're going to see what came out we're going to see what molecule came out.</span><br>
<br>

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[2:53:06]</small> <span title="2:53:06 - 2:53:14" data-start="02:53:06.378" data-end="02:53:14.357">This is saying that's not the only thing you can do there is a different kind of chemical Observer that you can imagine constructing which is somehow</span><br>
<span title="2:53:14 - 2:53:24" data-start="02:53:14.309" data-end="02:53:24.340">sensitive to this Dynamic Network exactly how that works how we make that measurement I don't know but a few ideas but that's what's important so to speak.</span><br>
<span title="2:53:24 - 2:53:34" data-start="02:53:24.428" data-end="02:53:34.387">And that that means and by the way you can do the same thing even for Turing machines you can say if you have a multi way turing machine you can say how do you compute with a multi-way turing machine.</span><br>
<span title="2:53:35 - 2:53:47" data-start="02:53:34.501" data-end="02:53:47.061">You cut you can't say well we got this input and this output because the thing has all these threads of time it's got lots of outputs and so then you say well what does it even mean to be a universal multi-way turing machine I don't fully know the answer to that,</span><br>
<span title="2:53:47 - 2:53:56" data-start="02:53:47.122" data-end="02:53:55.696">it had an interesting idea freak touring out for sure because then the Dynamics of the the trajectory of the competition matters.</span><br>
<span title="2:53:56 - 2:54:05" data-start="02:53:55.765" data-end="02:54:04.571">Yes yes I mean but the thing is that that so this is again a story of what's the Observer so to speak and chemistry what's the Observer there,</span><br>
<span title="2:54:05 - 2:54:13" data-start="02:54:04.623" data-end="02:54:12.511">now to give an example of where that might matter very sort of present-day example is in Immunology.</span><br>

<span title="2:55:57 - 2:56:00" data-start="02:55:56.863" data-end="02:55:59.927">Or is it something different from that is it something more dynamic.</span><br>
<span title="2:56:00 - 2:56:14" data-start="02:56:00.113" data-end="02:56:14.475">Is it something more like some network of interactions between these different kinds of immune systems cells and so on and it's known that there are plenty of interactions between T cells and you know there's plenty of Dynamics but what the consequence of that Dynamics is not clear.</span><br>
<span title="2:56:15 - 2:56:18" data-start="02:56:14.580" data-end="02:56:18.228">And to have a qualitative theory for that doesn't,</span><br>

<span title="3:37:20 - 3:37:27" data-start="03:37:20.130" data-end="03:37:26.578">is one kind of paradigmatic structure and you know you can you can imagine the same kind of thing that much more sort of.</span><br>
